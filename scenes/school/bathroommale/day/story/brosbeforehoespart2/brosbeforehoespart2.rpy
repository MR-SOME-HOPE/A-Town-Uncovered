    show jac shocked_talk at right
    jac "Well, this is why I wanted us to chat in a more private space since I didn’t want other people, especially not the ladies to hear."
    show jac confused_talk at right
    jac "This is… a bit more of an embarrassing part of me that I don’t really like to share or look back upon."
    jac "When I said I had a crush on her, that wasn’t necessarily 100\% the truth either."
    show pov bored_talk at left
    show jac shocked at right
    pov "I don’t follow."
    show pov bored at left
    show jac shocked_talk at right

    show jac confused_talk at right
    jac "I’m talking full on hyper fixated parasocial Vtuber simping levels of worship here."
    show jac angry_talk at right
    jac "I would constantly follow her everywhere, comment on all her social media posts, spend all my time in the comic book shop and be willing to do anything she asked of me."
    show jac confused_talk at right
    jac "I know it doesn’t sound too bad, but trust me. It was-"
    show pov bored_talk at left
    show jac shocked at right
    pov "How did it start?"
    show pov bored at left
    show jac bored_talk at right
    jac "Well, like all those types of things start. I was young and stupid."
    show jac smirk_talk at right
    jac "I wasn’t always the beacon of self-love and confidence man you see before you today, you know?"
    show jac bored_talk at right
    jac "I had a very bad awkward phase right after middle school and Hitomi-"
    show pov neutral at left
    show jac embarrassed_talk at right
    jac "She has always been nice to me, because that’s just the way she is!"
    show jac shocked_talk at right
    jac "But my awkward, nerdy head from back then didn’t know any better and I misread her signals and ended up falling down a very bad rabbit hole because of it."
    show pov embarrassed at left
    show jac bored_talk at right
    jac "One that took both Effie and Hitomi to pull me out of it, which also resulted in a brutal rejection and my permanent place in the friendzone with Hitomi."
    show pov embarrassed_talk at left
    show jac bored at right
    pov "Oh god- Dude, I’m so sorry..."
    show pov embarrassed at left
    show jac bored_talk at right
    jac "Thanks, but it needed to happen."
    show jac confused_talk at right
    jac "By the end of it, I was becoming more and more frustrated with how my advances were always ignored because Hitomi was too nice to hurt my feelings."
    jac "It all came to a boil when I started adopting some of those online incel ideas about hating women and thinking they owe men something or other and all that bullshit from other incels at the store who shared my pain."
    show pov smirk_talk at left
    show jac confused at right
    pov "Jesus..."
    show pov embarrassed at left
    show jac smirk_talk at right
    jac "Had Effie and Hitomi not put a stop to it and snapped me out of it, I would likely just have gone further down that hole and who knows how I would be today."
    show jac embarrassed_talk at right
    jac "Hitomi setting her foot down and telling me she wasn’t interested and telling me she hated what I was becoming… It pretty much acted like a bucket of cold water on my face."
    jac "Aided by the fact that Effie did drenched me in cold water using an actual bucket, but that’s beside the point."
    show pov smirk_talk at left
    show jac embarrassed at right
    pov "Definitely something she would do, nice she found a good reason to do so this time though."
    show pov confused at left
    show jac smirk_talk at right
    jac "Yeah, she kept doing it for a week at random just to make sure I was properly out of it."
    show pov embarrassed at left
    show jac embarrassed_talk at right
    jac "I was pushing away my friends over a stupid crush that got out of control but after that, I was able to start moving on."
    show pov neutral at left
    show jac smirk_talk at right
    jac "After that, I reinvented myself in the middle of high school, I apologized to Hitomi and I’ve never been happier!"
    show jac neutral_talk at right
    jac "Now I have tons of friends outside Hitomi and Effie and I feel much more comfortable with myself."
    show pov smirk at left
    show jac smirk_talk at right
    jac "All because I was able to move on from that stupid crush… Or at least I thought I did…"
    show pov smirk_talk at left
    show jac confused at right
    pov "What brought it back?"
    show pov shocked at left
    show jac confused_talk at right
    jac "Well, You did..."
    show pov confused at left
    show jac smirk_talk at right
    jac "But at the same time, I think Hitomi did- or rather- seeing her with you is what did it. How you arrived and started hanging out with her."
    show pov smirk at left
    show jac confused_talk at right
    jac "Dude, I’ve known her for a long time, so have all of the store regulars and even the guys on the back."
    show pov bored at left
    show jac shocked at right
    jac "And if you asked any of us, we would all tell you that the moment you arrived, something just- changed- with Hitomi."
    jac "She was doing expressions we’ve never seen before, talking in ways we’ve never heard before and just… Looking at you in a way she’s never looked at any one of us ever before."
    show pov neutral at left
    show jac embarrassed_talk at right
    jac "Then you started helping her out with her project and… And all those things became all the more apparent, became all the more frequent and they became all the extreme."
    show jac smirk_talk at right
    jac "It didn’t take us to roll a nat 20 on intelligence to figure out what was happening and how Hitomi was the one having a crush on someone rather than someone having a crush on her."
    show pov smirk_talk at left
    show jac smirk at right
    pov "You mean since the beginning, she…?"
    show pov neutral at left
    show jac smirk_talk at right
    jac "Dude, you haven’t known her for as long as we’ve had so it’s not weird for you to miss those changes."
    show jac shocked_talk at right
    jac "But I did… And added to that, the fact that she constantly asked for your help and input on things. Unlike when she is with us, who constantly asks her to let us help her out or offer to give her our input even if she doesn't ask for it."
    show jac smirk_talk at right
    jac "Well, it was clear you reached farther than any of us ever could with her-"
    show jac bored_talk at right
    jac "Farther than I ever could with her."
    show pov bored_talk at left
    show jac shocked at right
    pov "It was never a competition, Jacob. I didn’t really did anything special at first until I agreed to the whole modeling thing."
    show pov confused at left
    show jac embarrassed_talk at right
    jac "I know you didn’t, Dude."
    show pov shocked at left
    show jac neutral_talk at right
    jac "And that’s what was the most frustrating thing of this whole mess to me."
    show jac bored at right
    jac "You didn’t do anything special… You didn’t bend over backwards for her until she asked for your help, you didn’t worship the ground she walked upon, you didn’t even spend nearly as much time in the shop as the other guys and I did."
    show pov smirk at left
    show jac shocked_talk at right
    jac "And you Still managed to make her fall for you just like that."
    show pov embarrassed at left
    show jac neutral_talk at right
    jac "Just by being yourself and being the cool guy I’m proud to call my best friend."
    show pov neutral at left

    show jac embarrassed_talk at right

    show jac smirk_talk at right
    jac "No, man. I’m the one who’s sorry."
    show jac embarrassed_talk at right
    jac "I felt like justifying how I was feeling by convincing myself you were breaking the bro code or something."
    jac "Specifically, the law of not stealing your bros’ girl."
    show jac bored_talk at right
    jac "But for that rule to even take effect, one has to first indicate to their bro that the girl was his in the first place."
    show pov embarrassed at left
    show jac confused at right
    jac "And even before that, said bro should be in a relationship with said girl to begin with… Or even still having a crush on her."
    show pov confused at left
    show jac embarrassed_talk at right

    show pov neutral_talk at left
