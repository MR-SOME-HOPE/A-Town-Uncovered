    ## In class, you see that Coach Fistem is tasked in looking after the detention attendees but clearly uses the time to sleep instead of doing his job.

    ## In detention, you’re surprised to see the entire gang plus Cole.

    eff "What? How is that related?"

    eff "I was gonna say; keep your friends close and your enemies closer and that is 100%% what she’s intending on doing."
    eff "She wants our guard down."
