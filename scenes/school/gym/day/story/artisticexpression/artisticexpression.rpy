    show eff bored_talk at right

    show pov embarrassed at left
    show eff bored_talk at right
    eff "Yeah, we saw each other, we awkwardly tried to make conversation as we waited for the other to apologize first-"
    show eff shocked_talk at right
    eff "Then we just had breakfast in silence until we both caved and called truce."
    show pov confused at left
    eff "Then we both apologize at the same time and just buried the hatchet."
    show eff embarrassed_talk at right
    eff "So, the same routine as always, it should be a week or so until things go fully back to normal and we have another argument over something later on."
    show pov confused_talk at left
    show eff embarrassed at right
    pov "That really doesn't sound like a healthy relationship in the slightest."

    show eff embarrassed_talk at right

    show pov neutral_talk at left
    show eff embarrassed at right

    eff "Fair enough, I'll try to pop in on good days as well, I wouldn't want them to think I'm only looking for shelter like a stray cat or something."
    show eff confused_talk at right

    show pov neutral_talk at left
    show eff confused at right

    show pov embarrassed_talk at left
    show eff smirk at right
    pov "Still, I didn't know the school even had this sort of events."
    show pov embarrassed at left
    show eff smirk_talk at right
    eff "Ehhh, it's not really official, the art kids just kinda vandalize the place in an orderly manner to make their art be seen."
    show pov neutral at left
    show eff embarrassed_talk at right
    eff "Kind of like an art protest but Lashley actually allows it and made it into a school thing."
    show pov neutral_talk at left
    show eff confused at right
    pov "Is it really a protest if they are allowed to do it in the first place?"
    show pov neutral at left
    show eff bored_talk at right
    eff "Well, they did try to do an actual art protest against the TRC once, but that just ended up with a lot of 'em in actual trouble."
    show pov shocked at left
    show eff smirk_talk at right
    eff "So the idea of them trying to make actual change got squashed real quick and the art teacher who motivated them got fired real quick."
    show pov smirk_talk at left
    show eff smirk at right
