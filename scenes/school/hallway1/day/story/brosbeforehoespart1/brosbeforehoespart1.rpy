    show pov confused at left
    show jac shocked_talk at right

    show pov confused_talk at left
    show jac bored at right
    pov "I..."
    pov "I can’t really argue against that logic but it’s quite rude to point it out like that, you know?"
    show pov confused at left
    show jac bored_talk at right
    jac "Just calling it like I’m seeing it, dude."
    show pov smirk_talk at left
    show jac bored at right
    pov "Well, mad burns aside, I've been told by the gang in the nerd cave you would know best how to help Hitomi out considering you know her better."
    show pov embarrassed_talk at left
    show jac smirk at right
    pov "Do you have any advice that could help me out here?"
    show pov embarrassed at left
    show jac bored_talk at right

    show jac bored at right
    pov "You are taking a rain check? What does that even mean?"
    show pov shocked at left
    show jac bored_talk at right
    jac "It means I’m keeping my hands off this whole mess, man."
    jac "Sorry but I’m calling mulligan and reshuffling my deck here. I’m taking my chips off the poker table and bouncing out of the casino."
    show pov smirk at left
    show jac shocked_talk at right
    jac "I’m checking out of the hotel, abandoning ship before it sinks, separating the fellowship, ejecting the warp core-"
    show pov bored at left
    show jac confused_talk at right
    jac "I have more phrases like that but I think you get what I’m saying by this point?"
    show pov bored_talk at left
    show jac confused at right
    pov "Needles amount of phrases and references there to get your point across, but yeah I get you."
    show pov shocked_talk at left
    show jac bored at right
    pov "I get you and what the hell, man?!"
    show pov angry_talk at left
    pov "What happened to the whole 'I’m always happy to lend a hand to a bro' and stuff you were saying when I arrived?!"
    show pov angry at left
    show jac bored_talk at right
    jac "I mean, normally that’s the case and under normal circumstances I would be willing to go the extra mile here, but this is a mess I was purposefully set to the side in the first place, dude."
    show pov shocked at left
    show jac smirk_talk at right
    jac "I don’t feel it’s fair that I’m being asked to help out just because things went to shit, you know?"
    show pov angry at left
    show jac angry_talk at right
    jac "Especially because I would have been more than happy to continue helping out but it seems like I wasn't needed anymore and tossed aside."

    pov "Dude, what in the actual shit are you talking about?"
    show pov angry at left
    show jac angry_talk at right
    jac "I’m talking about the downright disrespect and multiple violations of the bro code and all it stands for, man!"
    show pov confused_talk at left
    show jac bored at right
    pov "That does not answer my question in any way whatsoever!"
    show pov smirk_talk at left
    pov "Dude, you’ve been super weird ever since I started hanging out with Hitomi yet you are never upfront as to what your deal actually is and frankly I’m getting sick of it."
    show pov angry_talk at left
    show jac smirk at right
    pov "Even Effie told you to cool it down and I know you respect her opinion over everyone else so can’t you at least tell me what the heck is up with you to be so jerkish with me lately?!"
    show pov shocked at left
    show jac angry_talk at right
    jac "Don’t you think it should be obvious by now?!"
    show pov angry at left
    show jac shocked_talk at right
    jac "I haven’t exactly been subtle about it and I would have hoped you picked up the signals by now."
    show pov angry_talk at left
    show jac shocked at right
    pov "I got way too much in my mind to be sensing your mind’s radio waves and I’ve never thought it was necessary for us to communicate like that when you and I have an open door policy!"
    show pov smirk_talk at left
    show jac bored at right
    pov "Maybe I do know what’s going on, but I still want to hear you up and say it!"
    show pov shocked_talk at left
    show jac confused at right
    pov "You are my best friend, man. We agreed we wouldn’t keep secrets from each other, didn’t we?!"
