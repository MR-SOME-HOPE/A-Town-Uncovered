    jac "C'mon, dude. You know I could never afford her on a part-time salary."
    jac "I just have to wait a few years for newer models to reduce her price to something more pocket friendly while making sure I don't wait so long that she is rendered completely obsolete."

    show pov smirk at left
    show jac neutral_talk at right

    jac "And while it is super depressive, you can't argue with how it hooks you in, once you start reading it!"
    show pov confused at left

    jac "Anyway, the publisher decided to do a remastered reprint of the first volume for its anniversary. And the first 200 copies would also be signed by the author himself!"

    show jac neutral_talk at right
    jac "And now you are looking at the proud owner of copy 198!"

    show pov neutral at left
    show jac smirk_talk at right
    jac "Wasn't easy. The shipping and import costs will haunt me for the rest of time. And I owe Cole a bunch of favors and to pay his therapist bill, for having him read it - but it was totally worth it!"

    jac "Fucked up and depressing plot aside; he is my favorite artist when it comes to character designs and drawing!"
    jac "He just has this way with the pen where he is able to capture the natural movement of a body while also exaggerating it just enough to make each shot as appealing as possible."

    jac "He is definitely one of my top artists, so the price in shipping was totally worth it!"

    pov "Couldn't you have just asked someone at the comic book shop to try and import some copies to sell here?"
    show pov embarrassed at left
    show jac smirk_talk at right
    jac "Come on, dude. You know this kinda hentai you can easily get for free online. Plus, by the time they got it, all signed copies would have been long gone!"
    jac "And engaging story aside, I doubt many people would be willing to try what's famously known around the internet as the saddest porn around you know?"

    show pov bored at left
    show jac shocked_talk at right

    show jac bored_talk at right
    jac "Yeah, you know. Drawing a dude or girl posing and trying to figure out body proportions? It's a fundamental in the world of drawing."

    show jac confused at right
    pov "Huh, perhaps we could suggest it to her."
    show pov smirk at left
    show jac bored_talk at right
    jac "Well, the troublesome part would be to find a model since they usually cost money and you only have them available for a limited time."

    show pov smirk_talk at left
    show jac shocked at right

    show pov smirk at left
    show jac embarrassed_talk at right
    jac "Right… Well, I should probably get home and frame it before doing anything else, then."
