    jac "Well, I’m just gonna go ahead and ask, and tear the band aid right off."

    show jac confused_talk at right
    jac "What the hell were you doing naked in the back room of the comic store, dude?"
    show pov smirk_talk at left
    show jac confused at right
    pov "Geez, really tearing the band aid right off without beating around the bush, huh?"
    show pov bored at left
    show jac shocked_talk at right
    jac "Well, The sooner I do it, then the sooner we can get rid of all the awkwardness in the air between us, right?"

    show jac smirk at right
    pov "Y-Yeah, fair enough…"
    pov "I was doing Hitomi a favor."

    pov "Remember when I said she was working on a webcomic?"
    show pov confused at left
    show jac neutral_talk at right
    jac "Yeah, I actually took some time to read it."
    show pov smirk at left
    show jac shocked_talk at right
    jac "It was really buried inside the webcomic website but once I found it, it was pretty fun to read, all things considered!"
    show pov neutral at left
    show jac smirk_talk at right
    jac "I’m definitely gonna keep it on my radar."
    show pov neutral_talk at left
    show jac smirk at right
    pov "Right, well, she needed extra practice with poses and anatomy, so we figured she could use me as reference for her pose work and overall anatomy practice."
    show pov neutral at left
    show jac confused_talk at right
    jac "She really needs a model for her webcomic? I mean, the artstyle for it is pretty simple - which is what makes it stand out, though."
    show pov embarrassed_talk at left
    show jac embarrassed at right
    pov "Yeah, she is actually launching another webcomic besides that one that requires more realistic proportions."
    show pov embarrassed at left
    show jac smirk_talk at right
    jac "Another webcomic when she’s just starting out?"
    show jac embarrassed_talk at right
    jac "That’s really-"
    show pov shocked_talk at left
    show jac embarrassed at right
    pov "Rushed, yeah. That’s what I told her, but she is pretty determined."
    show pov bored_talk at left
    show jac confused at right
    pov "So in order to help her practice, I agreed to model for her."
    show pov bored at left
    show jac confused_talk at right
    jac "I mean, that’s cool and all, dude - but did you really have to do it naked?"
    show pov neutral_talk at left
    show jac shocked at right
    pov "She insisted on it, actually."
    show pov confused at left
    show jac shocked_talk at right
    jac "Really?"
    show pov smirk_talk at left
    show jac confused at right
    pov "Yeah. Took me completely by surprise as well."
    show pov bored_talk at left
    show jac shocked at right
    pov "Anyway, Hitomi wanted me to talk to you and explain things out, so you wouldn’t get the wrong idea here."
    show pov bored at left
    show jac smirk_talk at right
    jac "And what exactly would have been the wrong idea, here?"
    show pov shocked_talk at left
    show jac smirk at right
    pov "What?"
    show pov confused at left
    show jac smirk_talk at right
    jac "I mean, I’m just asking. What did you guys think I thought when I stumbled into your “Modeling session”?"
    show pov confused_talk at left
    show jac smirk at right
    pov "I don’t know. How am I supposed to know what you were thinking?"
    show pov smirk_talk at left
    show jac shocked at right
    pov "Regardless, Hitomi asked me to talk to you in order to explain things because she is afraid that some weird rumors might come out because of this."
    show pov smirk at left
    show jac confused_talk at right
    jac "Wait, she doesn’t actually think I would go and spread rumors like that?"
    show pov shocked at left
    show jac angry_talk at right
    jac "You guys know me better than that!"
    show pov embarrassed_talk at left
    show jac angry at right
    pov "I’m sure she doesn’t think you would do it in a mean way, dude."
    show pov confused_talk at left
    show jac shocked_talk at right
    pov "It’s just that you tend to overshare things. And people could get the wrong idea if they don’t hear the whole story."
    show pov embarrassed at left
    show jac angry_talk at right
    jac "Whaaaat? Name one time I’ve ever done-"
    show pov bored_talk at left
    show jac confused at right
    pov "Do you REALLY wanna go down that route, Jacob?"
    show pov bored at left
    show jac confused_talk at right
    jac "…"
    jac "OK, maybe I do tend to overshare things when I get excited, but it’a not like I do it all the time!"
    show pov bored_talk at left
    show jac confused at right
    pov "Well, she didn’t want to take that risk, dude."
    show pov bored at left
    show jac confused_talk at right
    jac "… Fair enough…"
    jac "So, that whole thing was just a modeling session?"
    show pov smirk at left
    show jac smirk_talk at right
    jac "Nothing else was going on?"
    show pov smirk_talk at left
    show jac smirk at right
    pov "Yeah, we were actually about to finish by the time you barged in the back room."
    show pov smirk at left
    show jac bored_talk at right
    jac "So you were gonna get dressed and nothing else was going to happen?"
    show pov smirk_talk at left
    show jac smirk at right
    pov "I’m not sure what you are trying to get at, but {b}I{/b} wasn’t planning on doing anything else, at the very least."
    show pov smirk at left
    show jac smirk_talk at right
    jac "…"
    jac "Right…"
    show pov bored_talk at left
    show jac confused at right
    pov "You good, dude?"
    show pov bored at left
    show jac confused_talk at right
    jac "Yeah… Yeah, it’s just…"
    show jac shocked_talk at right
    jac "Well, I guess I’m feeling a little envious right now, but that’s really more of my problem - and I’ll just get over it."
    show pov smirk at left
    show jac shocked_talk at right
    jac "Sorry I got the wrong idea, dude."
    show pov smirk_talk at left
    show jac embarrassed at right
    pov "No problem, bro. Though I don’t really see what’s there to be jealous about."
    show pov embarrassed_talk at left
    pov "I was just doing Hitomi a favor."
    show pov embarrassed at left
    show jac embarrassed_talk at right
    jac "It’s not that, it’s just…"
    jac "Nevermind, best to just forget about it."
    show pov neutral_talk at left
    show jac embarrassed at right
    pov "So we’re cool?"
    show pov neutral at left
    show jac neutral_talk at right
    jac "Yeah dude, it was more of my bad to begin with."
    show pov neutral_talk at left
    show jac neutral at right
    pov "Alright, I’m sure Hitomi will be glad to hear that, then!"
    show pov confused_talk at left
    show jac smirk at right
    pov "Wanna get out of here and go get something to drink at the mall?"
    pov "My treat."
    show pov neutral at left
    show jac smirk_talk at right
    jac "I like the sound of that!"
    show pov confused at left
    show jac shocked_talk at right
    jac "Hey, by the way, how did you guys even manage to scare those guys away from the cave? They are pretty possessive about it."
    show pov embarrassed_talk at left
    show jac bored at right
    pov "That, my friend, is a mystery I doubt Hitomi will ever tell me the answer to."
    show pov confused at left
    show jac bored_talk at right
    jac "Chances are that they’ll try to take it back, you know?"
    show pov smirk_talk at left
    show jac smirk at right
    pov "Oh come on, give them a little credit. I’m sure they understand how important this is to Hitomi after all."
