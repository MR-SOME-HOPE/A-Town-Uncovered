    #-The Mc arrives at his locker only noticing how the students around his are all still talking-

    "Dudebro student" "Bro, even the after party was out of control!"
    "Dudebro student" "I have never partied this hard in my whole life!"

    "Brodude student" "I can tell bro, this was the party to end all parties."
    "Brodude student" "It shall signify the beginning of our hopeless descent into old age as the final beacon of unrestrained joy of youth. Since nothing in our lives from this point onward will ever possibly match the ephemeral happiness and downright spiritual connection that we all felt with our fellow man during the events of this party."
    "Brodude student" "It shall become the final send off to the best years of our life as we all enter into the grey and uncaring maws of the system that will consume the rest of our miserable and unimportant existence."
    "Brodude student" "All of which will lead to the realization that we have wasted even more time trying to recapture that happiness rather than enjoying the small joys life lent to us, before we are swallowed whole by the unending and indiscriminately indifference of the universe."

    "Dudebro student" "…"
    "Dudebro student" "Bro..."
    "Dudebro student" "I knew letting you take your minor in Nihilist Philosophy was a bad idea!"
    "Dudebro student" "You just had to chase after that hot goth chick that majors in philosophy, didn’t you?"

    "Brodude student" "That hot goth chick who I totally scored with at Zariah’s party, you mean?"

    "Dudebro student" "THERE’S THE BRO I KNOW! NICE, DUDE!"
