    idk "My darling, brothers and sisters-"
    idk "Today, let us reflect upon the timeless wisdom of lust, arousal, and fertility."
    idk "As we gather here in this sacred space, let us remember the importance of embracing these moral values in our daily lives."

    eff "{i}*Whisper*{/i} What the fuck is this-"

    jac "{i}*Whisper*{/i} There’s so many attendees-"
    jac "{i}*Whisper*{/i} Can you guys recognize anyone?"

    edw "Shhh-!"

    mas "One of the fundamental principles that we can learn from the teachings of myself, Master Buukakki is the power of unconditional lust."
    mas "I’ve taught you all to fuck one another, regardless of our differences or shortcomings."
    mas "This means giving oral, anal, and facials to everyone we encounter-"
    mas "Spreading our love seeds like a beacon of hope in a world often plagued by division and hatred."

    col "{i}*Whisper*{/i} This definitely doesn’t sound like any church sermon."

    jac "{i}*Whisper*{/i} I’m kinda into it-"

    edw "{i}*Whisper*{/i} Don’t get suckered in!!"

    mas "Additionally, the principle of perversion calls us to recognize the sexual suffering of others and to respond with genuine care and support."
    mas "Perversion urges us to extend a helping hand to those in need, to offer handjobs to the lonely, and to drain the dry-spelled."
    mas "By embracing perversion, we create a ripple effect of positive change that can transform not only individual lives but also entire communities."

    jac "*Whispers* Make sense. Make sense."

    mas "…"
    mas "It is crucial to acknowledge that foreplay is an essential component of lust and perversion."
    mas "It is through foreplay that we release the pent up anger, frustrations, and bitterness."
    mas "Foreplay does not mean ignoring or disregarding the uncontrollable drive erupting within us-"
    mas "Rather, it is a deliberate choice to embrace and show gratitude with a renewed spirit of lust and euphoria."

    col "{i}*Whisper*{/i} Foreplay IS very important, not gonna lie."

    mas "The quick lesson we can draw from these morals and principles is that our actions matter."
    mas "Every sexual encounter, every ejaculation, and every penetration has the potential to shape lives and inspire others."
    mas "As followers of Master Buukakki-"
    mas "We are called to be beacons of lust and perversion, offering foreplay and euphoria to those around us."

    pov "{i}*Whisper*{/i} Man, everyone in here is EATING this up."

    edw "{i}*Whisper*{/i} Yeah, no kidding. It even got Jacob."

    mas "Yes, I do see that shy group in the back. Don’t be scared, my beloved."
    mas "I can sense you’re frightened."
    mas "The heart beats fast but it’s quite different from one of lust."
