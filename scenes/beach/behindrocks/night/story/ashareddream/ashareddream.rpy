    vio "Just a typical Tuesday for me."
    vio "Rescues aren’t out of the ordinary for me, I’m glad it doesn’t happen TOO often."
    vio "But the nudity makes people think they’re invincible for some reason."
    vio "New and first time nudists sorta have to switch that part of their brain off that holds shame and security."
    vio "So in turn they become overly confident and become drunk with naked euphoria."
    vio "Mix that with not knowing how to swim and how to read the waves and you got yourself a disaster on your hands."

    vio "Hey, what do you plan on doing when you reach the end of training?"
    vio "Have you considered getting into taking the test for lifeguard certification?"
    vio "As I said in the interview, we could always use more lifeguards."

    pov "And-"
    pov "Well, also…"
    pov "I wanted to get to know you and spend time around you."
