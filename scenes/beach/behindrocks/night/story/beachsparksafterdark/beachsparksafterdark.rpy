    pov "Basic ass-"

    vio "Hahahahaha"
    vio "It’s el’ classico."

    vio "If we’re talking basic bitches, you pick the one that’s most popular."
    vio "Super vanilla, same as everyone else, not unique."
    vio "1 outta 5."

    pov "Whatever, agree to disagree."

    vio "*Sigh*"
    vio "It doesn’t matter how many nights I see, the ones at the beach never fails to relax and refresh me."

    show bg beachsparksafterdark_6
    pov "I totally get it, the super cool breeze, fresh nightly air."
    pov "It’s a completely different world."

    vio "I like to sit here and think- y’know."
    vio "Get a little meditation in."
    vio "The whole day is a work on your body and mind."
    vio "It’s important to relax as well."

    show bg beachsparksafterdark_2
    pov "I hear ya."
    pov "I could get used to this."

    show bg beachsparksafterdark_1
    vio "You actually got used to the whole nudity thing very quickly."
    vio "Not to say that it’s not-not normal."
    vio "It depends on your upbringing and your idea of freedom and your own self-image I guess."
    vio "Believe or not, I wasn’t very comfortable with my body in my earlier years."

    show bg beachsparksafterdark_2
    pov "Really?"
    pov "But you’re such a natural at being- well… natural."
    pov "I wouldn’t have thought of you as anything but a true born nudist."

    show bg beachsparksafterdark_5
    vio "It really took me a while to get truly comfortable with being like this and now that I am, I could never see myself going back to a conservative, clothed lifestyle."
    vio "I am where the freedom is."
    vio "This is where I feel my truest and happiest self."
    vio "The only reason I HAVE clothes is for the travel to and from the beach and my home, and if I need to hit up any places in town."
    vio "Every piece of clothing item I own can fit in a backpack."

    show bg beachsparksafterdark_2
    pov "Wow, even during the colder days?"

    show bg beachsparksafterdark_1
    vio "I’ve got blankets and a robe, nothing too restrictive."

    show bg beachsparksafterdark_2
    pov "That sounds really cool."

    show bg beachsparksafterdark_5
    vio "I was a junior lifeguard way before my nudist lifestyle but when the family moved into this town, we only HAD the nudist beach."
    vio "I took the opportunity, putting my fears and anxiety aside for the safety of the people."
    vio "I-"
    vio "I cared more about making sure the beach was safe than I was about how and if people saw my naked body."
    vio "And believe me, back then, I cared about people seeing me naked very, very much."
    vio "But it was something I overcame and overcame I did."
    vio "Honestly, that’d be an understatement, I overcame and kept running full speed past that initial barrier."

    pov "You’ve got an amazing body, something worth showing off, how could you be embarrassed by it?"

    show bg beachsparksafterdark_1
    vio "Hahaha- I’ve only got a great body because I’m athletic and fit. Being athletic and fit doesn’t automatically make you brave and fearless."
    vio "You understand?"

    show bg beachsparksafterdark_2
    pov "I understand. Like just because someone has a great singing voice, doesn’t alleviate them from stage fright."

    show bg beachsparksafterdark_1
    vio "You’re a smart cookie, [povname]."
    vio "*Sigh*"
    show bg beachsparksafterdark_5
    vio "I love the beach and I love the people who come to it."
    vio "I see regulars and new faces."
    vio "They love taking photos with me, I feel like a celebrity!"
    vio "Hahahaha."
    vio "But I know they just wanna get some skin to skin with me."

    show bg beachsparksafterdark_6
    pov "You make coming to the beach very worth it."
    pov "Besides feeling safe, you are definitely brighter than the blazing sand."

    show bg beachsparksafterdark_1
    vio "That’s so fucking corny, [povname]."
    vio "You’re trying to make me blush, aren’t you?"

    show bg beachsparksafterdark_2
    pov "Me? Make you blush? Psssh no?"

    show bg beachsparksafterdark_5
    vio "Yesss~"
    vio "You like me, you really really like me, don’t you?"

    show bg beachsparksafterdark_2
    pov "Why would I like you?"
    pov "Like, c’mon. Of course I like you cause you’re really cool and sexy but it’s really hard to really like you when you’re making me run 50 laps."

    show bg beachsparksafterdark_1
    vio "You like it."
    vio "I know you do, hehehe."
    vio "Don’t worry, [povname]. I’ve been enjoying our training sessions too."
    vio "Watching you sweat and put your heart and soul into becoming stronger and smarter is…"
    vio "Exciting."

    vio "I’ll give you a BJ!"

    show bg beachsparksafterdark_8
    pov "Wai- what?"

    show bg beachsparksafterdark_7
    vio "Just a little outdoor fun between a trainer and a trainee."
    vio "We can’t drink beer on the beach so this’ll do."

    show bg beachsparksafterdark_8
    pov "Erm-"

    show bg beachsparksafterdark_7
    vio "What? Don’t you want one?"
    vio "Think of it as a good job reward for making it this far in the program."

    show bg beachsparksafterdark_9
    pov "Okay, y’know what. Why not?"

    show bg beachsparksafterdark_10
    vio "That’s the spirit! We’re here for a good time, not a long time."
    vio "Well- it’s our job to make sure people live but that’s besides the point."
