    show naughtywindsmouth talk
    hit "Yep! I uploaded the next chapter just in time, so now I have a cool-off period and wanted to draw for fun, for a change of pace."
    hit "To try and recapture when I could just draw without worrying about what people may think or overanalyzing every miniscule detail I made on a piece."

    show naughtywindsmouth neutral
    pov "Sounds like you are enjoying your break, then!"
    pov "You certainly seem quite relaxed."

    show naughtywindsmouth talk
    hit "For sure. I will admit that the whole thing that happened during our last modeling session definitely helped release some tensions I was having…"

    pov "I’m… really sorry about what happened back there…"

    show naughtywindsmouth talk
    hit "Oh, no no no! You don’t need to apologize for anything, [povname]!"
    show naughtywindsmouth boredtalk
    hit "If nothing else, it was Effie who made the slip-up. And I was the one who overreacted!"

    show naughtywindsmouth bored
    pov "I still feel a bit responsible, regardless…"
    show naughtywindsmouth neutral
    pov "And speaking of Effie, I assure you that she feels terrible about what happened."

    show naughtywindsmouth talk
    hit "I know."
    show naughtywindsmouth boredtalk
    hit "She came over to my place two days ago and she apologized profusely for what happened."
    show naughtywindsmouth talk
    hit "I was a bit mad at first, and definitely quite embarrassed - but we made up, hugged it out and I’ve forgiven her already, so it’s all now in the past."

    show naughtywindsmouth neutral
    pov "I’m really glad to hear that. She was really mortified. As was I."

    show naughtywindsmouth talk
    hit "Yeah, she made that clear too."
    hit "You guys are quite close, huh?"

    show naughtywindsmouth neutral
    pov "Well, she was one of my first friends when I moved into town, alongside Jacob."
    pov "I definitely have quite the soft spot for both of them, as they were the first two to give the new kid a chance, you know?"

    show naughtywindsmouth boredtalk
    hit "Yeah, that makes sense."
    show naughtywindsmouth talk
    hit "They are like your closest squad of main characters to your protagonist self and therefore the most fleshed out for you as you naturally spent more time with them since you met them first, right?"

    show naughtywindsmouth neutral
    pov "Weird way to put it, but yes, I suppose that’s correct."
    pov "However, that doesn’t mean I don’t see you as a close friend either."
    pov "I’d say by now I’ve spent quite a long time with you too. And we’ve come to know each other quite well, wouldn’t you say?"

    show naughtywindsmouth talk
    hit "Y-Yeah, I feel the same way!"
    hit "You help me out a lot, you are always there when I need you and you are even willing to do so much for me, just because you think it would make me happy…"
    hit "What kind of person would I be if I didn’t consider you a close friend, after all of that?"
    show naughtywindsmouth boredtalk
    hit "Though… sometimes I feel bad because I haven’t done nearly as much for you as you have for me… I worry that I’m just burdening you…"

    show naughtywindsmouth bored
    pov "You are not, I assure you."
    show naughtywindsmouth neutral
    pov "It’s just… maybe the opportunity hasn’t shown itself for you to help me out!"
    pov "I mean, not that you have to, for me to be your friend or anything, but if it’s that big a deal for you, I’ll be sure to let you know if I ever do need some help in the future."

    show naughtywindsmouth talk
    hit "I’d like that… And I’ll do my very best to help you out in return, once that time comes and any other time you need my help!"

    show naughtywindsmouth neutral
    pov "Not that you’d need to; but I would appreciate it."
    pov "Anyway, regardless of help or not, you definitely know me far too well by now, to not consider us close friends."
    pov "Nudist beach aside and all, one can’t say they aren’t close to a friend when they’ve seen them naked more than once, in my opinion."

    show naughtywindsmouth talk
    hit "Heh, that’s true. Not to mention I’ve also seen you have sex with another girl though I suppose that’s one of those close friend secrets we shouldn’t discuss in public, huh?"

    show naughtywindsmouth neutral
    pov "Heh, for sure."
    pov "Sorry, it seems like no matter the conversation, we keep going back to that topic. Sorry if I'm reminding you…"

    show naughtywindsmouth talk
    hit "Don’t apologize!"
    show naughtywindsmouth boredtalk
    hit "To be honest with you, it’s also been on my mind all day too…"
    hit "I got too carried away for my references, and we all got caught up in the mood, and it was a slippery slope after that."
    hit "After the rush of the whole thing hit me, I was super embarrassed that I forced the two of you to do it, with me watching like some kind of perv."
    hit "God, I must have looked so bad to you…"

    show naughtywindsmouth bored
    pov "Not at all!"
    pov "Plus we weren’t exactly forced and were cool with it. It was just surprising is all!"

    show naughtywindsmouth boredtalk
    hit "Yes, but I think I’m done with that kind of modeling, where I’m third wheeling like that."
    hit "I don’t think I could look at Effie in the eye ever again if I saw her having sex more than once in my lifetime."
    show naughtywindsmouth talk
    hit "Don’t get me wrong, she is a dear friend and I have a lot to thank her for, but it’s definitely way over the line of what I’d like to know her as."
    hit "That being said, I’m quite happy with the results I got from your modeling, so I hope you can continue to support me in that regard."

    show naughtywindsmouth neutral

    pov "You were very adamant about needing them, in the first place."

    show naughtywindsmouth boredtalk
    hit "Well… truthfully, I have a solution and alternative that should make everyone happy. But I’ll tell you about it a little bit later."
