    ## CG
    #-Scene takes place immediately after the previous one, with a fade from black to reveal Mc and Effie snuggling in bed naked, hickeys and love bites all over them and Effie with her hair down as she comfortably sleeps on top of the Mc-

    #-Scene remains in black as Effie’s voice wakes the MC up slowly-

    eff "[povname]..."

    #-Mc’s eyes open halfway, the blurry vision letting him see the silhouette of Effie laying on top of him-

    pov "Mnnn…"

    eff "[povname], wake up…"
    eff "Come on, now. It’s time to get up."

    pov "Wh-What…?"

    #-Mc’s eyes fully open and he is met with the smiling face of Effie in all her nude glory-

    pov "Effie?"

    eff "Heh. Good Morning, handsome~"
    eff "Seems like you slept well, huh?"

    pov "What time is it?"

    eff "Early."
    eff "I didn’t want to wake you up just yet but I’m getting hungry and figured we both could get some breakfast, so I got tired of waiting for ya."

    pov "You could have just gotten up and gotten something if you were that hungry."

    eff "Well, that’s true…"
    eff "But I also was just way too comfy to want to get up by myself."
    eff "How did you sleep? You were out like a light."

    pov "I slept great, actually!"
    pov "Feeling better than I’ve had in a while."

    #-Shift perspective to standing figures as Effie and MC get up-
