    show bg daddyainthappy_1
    eff "Yep! Just finishing getting ready over here, I’ll be right down!"
    show bg daddyainthappy_4
    pov "Alright, but please hurry up, I don’t want to stumble into your dad by accident while waiting for you..."
    show bg daddyainthappy_5
    eff "Relax! I’ve managed to wrangle him a little bit."
    eff "I mean, he was still pretty much pissed, but I at least managed to make him let me see you."
    show bg daddyainthappy_4
    pov "How did you manage to even let me be near you to begin with?"
    show bg daddyainthappy_5
    eff "I have my ways around him, though this time I had to concede to some of his BS."
    show bg daddyainthappy_6
    eff "Like allowing him to talk to you before we head off."
    show bg daddyainthappy_7
    pov "Wait, what?!"
    show bg daddyainthappy_6
    eff "Relax! He just wants to flex the macho man persona a little and act like an 80’s cliche for a bit. And he promised not to make as big of a scene this time."
    show bg daddyainthappy_7
    pov "Effie, last time he threatened to pull a gun on me!"
    show bg daddyainthappy_6
    eff "I told you, it won’t go like that again!"
    eff "Please, [povname]. I had to agree to let him do this so he would let me go out with you in general, not to mention going out for real!"
    eff "You don’t even know half of the rules he has on me now, so can you please do this for me?"
    show bg daddyainthappy_4
    pov "I-I mean, when you put it like that, it’s not like I can really refuse, can I?"
    show bg daddyainthappy_5
    eff "Thanks, [povname]. I promise I’ll make it up to you."
    show bg daddyainthappy_4
    pov "Yeah, yeah. Don’t mention it."
    pov "Still, are you sure that he isn’t going to do anything too crazy or-"

    effdad "That’s the minimum a man should be able to do when they are supposedly interested in a lady..."
    show pov bored_talk at left
    show effdad smirk at right
    pov "I’d rather let Effie make her own choices and give her a chance to decide on what we get to do or not."

    show effdad shocked_talk at right
    effdad "And if her grades are affected, in even the slightest bit because she is distracted with your dumbass, I’ll make sure you have hell to pay."
    effdad "Right now, all she should be focusing on is making sure she graduates, but since she is so adamant on seeing you for some reason, this is the rule she has to stick to."
