## Android Apocalypse
label lbl_android_apocalypse:
    ## Shot of the garbage bin, you peek your head out and witness the start of the android onslaught.

    ## Shot of Hitomi on the street getting railed missionary by a VI android, tears running down their face.

    ## Shot of Hazel on the street getting spitroasted, tears as well

    ## Shot of Steven being ridden while also having been sat on his face by two androids, struggling for air.

    ## You all carefully exit the bins and climb on top of it to reach the roof of the comic book store building

    ## From that vantage point you can see the town getting assaulted.

    ## You notice people on the beach, streakers and nudists happily running around not being attacked.

    pov "Those people aren’t being attacked though…"

    eff "You think it’s because they’re from the sex world?"

    col "That’s the most likely reason…"

    pov "Hmmph…"

    jac "Guys. Look over at The Robotics Company building."

    edw "Jesus fuck…"

    ## Again shot of the VIs flying out of the warehouse.

    ## SCENE END
