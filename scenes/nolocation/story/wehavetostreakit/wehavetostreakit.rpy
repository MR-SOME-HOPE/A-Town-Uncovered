    ## Back to the team.

    ## Shot of them hiding behind a corner of a building, eyeing the TRC building but it’s surrounded by VI-droids.

    pov "We need to get inside there and stop the invasion somehow."
    pov "Edward, if we can get you into one of the server rooms, can you hack into it and stop this?"

    edw "That would be a piece of cake."
    edw "The problem we have, [povname], is getting IN to the building."
    edw "Look! It’s fully surrounded by those androids."

    jac "How the hell are we gonna get past them?"

    col "Well, we saw some nudists at the beach streaking."

    eff "Presumably from the sexworld."

    col "They were totally being ignored by the android, didn’t see a single one of them being pinned down."

    eff "It’s worth a shot."

    pov "What do you mean it’s worth a shot."

    eff "It’s time to go [povname]-mode."

    pov "…"
    pov "Are you saying we all should streak into the building to bypass the androids."

    col "Ding ding ding! 50 points to you."

    pov "{i}*Sigh*{/i}"
    pov "Did you really have to call it [povname]-mode."

    edw "It’s a good name."

    jac "Yeah, we all understood the assignment."

    pov "…"
    pov "Everyone strip down to literally nothing."
    pov "We’re going [povname]-mode!"

    edw "Whooo!!"
    edw "Wait- why amd I getting excited about this."

    col "We’ve all seen it, Edward."
    col "Plus this is a matter of life or death."

    eff "C’mon."
    eff "Before any of them suspect otherwise."

    ## CG
    ## Everyone unclothes and runs across the street confidently.

    ## They run past the VIs, some of them looking at them but not looking to attack them.

    jac "Oh my God, it actually worked."

    eff "Of course it worked! We’re totally from the sex world."

    col "Yeah! I can think nothing BUT sex."

    edw "It’s really cold today, guys. I’m just saying!"

    ## They enter the building successfully.
