    dan "Yeah! I felt like I genuinely died and went to heaven and living out all my dreams."

    ded "I felt a heightened sense of connection to- everyone."
    ded "Like imagine being hugged and loved by literally everyone but instead of it being overwhelming, you just have a never ending bucket for love."

    dan "All I wanted was more."
    dan "More and more and more."

    ded "I was satisfied and not at the same time, it was- weird."
    ded "Like eating your favourite comfort food but never being able to feel full."

    pov "Love."

    jac "Yeah, ‘love’."

    edw "Shh."

    ded "It felt like the most amazing sleep ever but embarrassingly, we were both feeling really hot, sweaty, and sticky for some reason."
    ded "The whole house was a mess."
    ded "We didn’t have any clothes on."

    dan "We thought it was a heatwave that made us pass out."
    dan "And we tried to cool ourselves off in the bath or something but-"
    dan "I don’t know."
    dan "We’re home and safe now though."

    pov "Do you feel your relationship has strengthened since?"

    ded "Oh! Most definitely, I’ve never been closer to my Daniel in my life."
    ded "I love him so much."
    ded "I just want to love him all the time."

    dan "And we are!"
    dan "It feels so… natural and normal."

    dan "It’s how we cope and it feels good so why stop?"

    ded "Exactly."

    ded "You’re not gonna write an article or an essay on us are you?"
