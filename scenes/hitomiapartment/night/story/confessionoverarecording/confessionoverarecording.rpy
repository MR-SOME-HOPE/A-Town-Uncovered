    pov "It feels kinda weird to rewatch ourselves after just having sex, doesn’t it?"
    pov "Why are we doing this again?"

    hit "W-Well, I won’t deny that it does feel a little bit strange…"
    hit "B-But even so, I need to make sure the poses we did end up in the proper frame of the camera or at least close enough where I can just fill in the details later."
    hit "That way, we can take advantage you are still here if we need to… reshoot…"

    hit "Hehe, as much as I wouldn’t be opposed to such a thing, I’m feeling quite sore right now actually…"

    scene bg confessionoverarecording_4
    pov "Oh, shit. I didn’t hurt you, did I?"

    scene bg confessionoverarecording_5
    hit "N-No! Not at all!"
    hit "T-This is the good kind of soreness!"
    hit "Like a satisfying workout or a good stretch! In fact, I’m feeling better than I’ve had in years!"

    scene bg confessionoverarecording_6
    pov "I-I see…"
    pov "Well, I’m glad you enjoyed it so much."

    scene bg confessionoverarecording_7
    hit "Gosh, J-J-Just what are you making me admit outloud, man! Quit teasing me!"

    scene bg confessionoverarecording_6
    pov "Hehehe, sorry, sorry."
    pov "Still, I was worried things were getting too rough at some spots so I’m glad you enjoyed yourself."

    scene bg confessionoverarecording_7
    hit "I mean… It was definitely a bit rougher than the time we accidentally ended up having sex on the beach, but I’m a big girl and can take more than what you give me credit for, you know?"
    hit "N-Not that I’m saying I’m too experienced on this either or that I frequently do this or-!"
    hit "God, why do I keep tripping on my words whenever I’m with you…"

    scene bg confessionoverarecording_6
    pov "I’m really not sure how to answer that but I’ll keep it in mind then."

    scene bg confessionoverarecording_2
    hit "M-My point is!"
    hit "I-I’m really happy this happened and I had a very good time, [povname]."

    scene bg confessionoverarecording_6
    pov "That’s a relief then."

    scene bg confessionoverarecording_8
    hit "S-Still… There is something that is bothering me about all this…"

    scene bg confessionoverarecording_9
    pov "And that is?"

    scene bg confessionoverarecording_8
    hit "The fact that… Well, I don’t know what will happen now…"
    hit "What will happen with 'us' specifically…"

    scene bg confessionoverarecording_9
    pov "Oh…"
    pov "Right…"

    scene bg confessionoverarecording_5
    hit "[povname], you’ve done so much for me and at the same time we have spent a lot of time together and…"
    hit "And I wasn’t lying or hyping myself up when I was talking about wanting to know you better."
    hit "I… I genuinely feel a connection with you and I want to become something important to you…"

    scene bg confessionoverarecording_3
    pov "Hitomi, you already are-"

    scene bg confessionoverarecording_8
    hit "I want to be more than that!"
    hit "I-I want to be more than just how you see me right now…"
    hit "Perhaps it’s out of a sudden, perhaps I’m acting irrationally…"
    hit "B-But it is what I want and what I’m going to be striving for."

    scene bg confessionoverarecording_9
    pov "I really don’t deserve all this devotion from you, Hitomi. I would have done it all again happilly if you asked me again."
    pov "That’s just the kind of guy I am."

    scene bg confessionoverarecording_7
    hit "Well, is it wrong for me to want to be with the kind of guy you are?"

    scene bg confessionoverarecording_4
    pov "I…"

    scene bg confessionoverarecording_8
    hit "L-Look, I’m not asking you to accept my feelings wholeheartedly just yet and neither am I asking you to commit to anything either…"
    hit "honestly, I still feel like I’ve done nothing but abuse your kindness with all the things I’ve made you do that I wouldn’t be surprised if you were hesitant for us to be more than just friends…"
    hit "All that I want… All that I’m asking… Is for me to have a space in your life… however big or small the role, as long as I get to be present and someone you can feel like you can rely on…"
    hit "Then I’ll be happy…"
    hit "Even if it means we are just close friends… Close friends that happen to also have the occasional intimacy together… I-If you still want to of course!"

    scene bg confessionoverarecording_9
    pov "I still don’t know what I’ve done to deserve all of this…"

    scene bg confessionoverarecording_7
    hit "You’ve been present."
    hit "Every step of the way, you’ve been there as I struggled with things, as I learned the ropes, as I got motivated, as I dealt with criticism."
    hit "Everytime I remember any part of the process that got me to this point, you’ve always popped into my mind as the one constant factor throughout all of it…"
    hit "I’ve never had anyone be that present for me before."

    scene bg confessionoverarecording_4
    pov "What are you talking about? You’ve told me you had tons of support from everyone around you."

    scene bg confessionoverarecording_5
    hit "I’m not denying that, but there is a very clear difference between some occasional words of encouragment with a show of polite interest and a constant presence of support and genuine interest…"
    hit "I mean, don’t get me wrong either. I’m very grateful for that kind of support too."
    hit "But at the same time, it just doesn’t compare in my mind to the kind you’ve given me, even if saying that makes me look super bad…"

    scene bg confessionoverarecording_4
    pov "I still don’t get what the difference is, honestly speaking…"

    scene bg confessionoverarecording_7
    hit "Well, my parents do ask me about it and some guys at the store tell me their thoughts on the occasional chapter."
    hit "But you were there for me when I needed you right as I was making it!"
    hit "You were integral in the creative process, you were a constant source of motivation, you were there to assist me whenever I had troubles…"
    hit "I’m thankful for the support I’ve received from everyone as I’ve shown the results of my work… But it was thanks to your support that I’ve been able to even make those results in the first place…"
    hit "Simply put… If it wasn’t because of you being there for me and being my rock to support myself on… I don’t think I would have gotten nearly as far as I’ve gotten today…"

    scene bg confessionoverarecording_4
    pov "Don’t say that, you are talented and passionate, you would have done just fine even without my help!"

    scene bg confessionoverarecording_8
    hit "That is simply not true, [povname]. I know myself better than anyone…"
    hit "I’m the kind of girl that tends to give up on projects if they don’t show immediate success or tries to find ways to circumvent or shortcut the process…"
    hit "I don’t know why I do it or if it’s something creative types have, but…"
    hit "I know that if you hadn’t been there to motivate me, to show interest in what I’m doing and to give me that instant recognition I was craving in the beginning…"
    hit "I know I would have saved myself the troubles and the headaches I’m currently facing and just stopped myself from going further with the project."

    scene bg confessionoverarecording_9
    pov "That’s… Really not something I ever expected to hear from you considering how passionate you’ve always seemed about the project every time we talked."

    scene bg confessionoverarecording_7
    hit "Well… That’s because talking about it with you and getting excited over showing you my progress or waiting for our next conversation would always serve as a way to keep the flame burning…"
    hit "Any overly creative type will tell you that a project starts with this overly passionate source of creativity that slowly dwindles out more and more as the project goes on or takes longer and longer to materialize…"
    hit "It’s really hard to keep the flame burning and it isn’t rare for them to want to think about quitting or move onto something else…"
    hit "It takes real passion and dedication to finish a large project, especially one that takes much longer than expected."
    hit "One needs to find their own motivation to keep going and to commit themselves to see it through to the end."

    scene bg confessionoverarecording_6
    pov "And you are saying that your motivation to keep pushing forward through those moments all along has been…"

    scene bg confessionoverarecording_5
    hit "You… Since the very first time you reached out your hand to help me out and showed genuine interest in my work…"

    scene bg confessionoverarecording_6
    pov "Wow…"

    scene bg confessionoverarecording_7
    hit "Yeah…"
    hit "It didn’t really hit me how I felt until recently and… Again, I don’t want to just dump this whole thing on you and expect you to just fully accept my feelings just like that."
    hit "But even if we just remain close friends, as long as I can be close enough to you to feel like I can begin paying you for all the times you’ve helped me believe in myself and what I’m doing…"
    hit "Then even then, I’ll be happy…"

    scene bg confessionoverarecording_4
    pov "Would you really be happy with just that much?"

    scene bg confessionoverarecording_5
    hit "Yes… Because you mean more to me than just the label a relationship would give us, but I would be lying if I said I didn’t want to have such a label one day either…"
    hit "As long as You can see me as someone as close as I see you… Then I am genuinely satisfied…."

    pov "I still don’t like how you feel like you need to pay me back for all that I’ve done, but if you are thanking me right now for allowing you to be a bit selfish through this whole time…"
    pov "Then I think it’s only fair that I’m allowed to be selfish this one time and just come out and say how I feel… While fully accepting all that you are showing me…"
