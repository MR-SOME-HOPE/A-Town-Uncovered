    scene bg apredictablerealization_1
    with dissolve
    pov "Just in time. She shouldn’t take long..."
    scene bg apredictablerealization_2
    with dissolve
    eff "Hey!"

    #-Effie shows up on scene and sits down next to the MC-

    scene bg apredictablerealization_4
    with dissolve
    eff "{i}*Pants*{/i} Sorry for the delay, I had to wrap things up as quickly as I could before the manager asked me to do something else before my shift ended."

    eff "Did I keep you waiting long?"
    scene bg apredictablerealization_6
    with dissolve
    pov "Not at all. I was actually about to text you that I had arrived just now."
    scene bg apredictablerealization_5
    with dissolve
    eff "Oh…"

    eff "Well, now I feel silly over the fact I basically ran away from my workplace thinking I was late and making you wait."

    eff "Seems like I got panicked and sweaty over nothing, huh?"

    pov "Heh, pretty much but at least you weren’t late."
    scene bg apredictablerealization_3
    with dissolve
    pov "Will you get in trouble at work for this, though?"

    eff "Eh, I doubt it considering how often I do them a solid by showing up when they are short on staff or to cover the shift of someone sick or absent or whatever."
    scene bg apredictablerealization_5
    with dissolve
    pov "You do that a lot?"
    eff "Mostly as an excuse to get extra time out of my house and away from my old man after an argument."

    eff "So yeah, you can be sure that these last few days I've been racking a lot of extra hours."
    scene bg apredictablerealization_6
    with dissolve
    pov "So, what did you want us to talk about?"

    eff "Well… We kind of left thing a bit of a mess last time with my dad barging in and going ape shit."
    scene bg apredictablerealization_5
    with dissolve
    pov "Yeah, I wanted to say something but I didn’t think it was wise to stick around when he kept going on and on about showing off his gun to me."
    scene bg apredictablerealization_3
    with dissolve
    eff "Yeah, he has a habit of waving that thing around to scare off people."
    scene bg apredictablerealization_5
    with dissolve
    pov "How has he not been arrested yet?!"
    eff "We have family friends in the station so they go easy on him as long as he doesn’t go too crazy."
    scene bg apredictablerealization_6
    with dissolve
    eff "By now he knows how much he can get away with without landing in the slammer."

    eff "Despite how I wish they sometimes did made him spend at least a night in jail…"

    eff "Maybe that way he’d at least cool off and finally stop freaking out about everything."
    scene bg apredictablerealization_5
    with dissolve
    pov "I can’t imagine-"
    scene bg apredictablerealization_6
    with dissolve
    eff "So, can we get back on topic and put a pin on my psycho dad for now?"
    scene bg apredictablerealization_5
    with dissolve
    pov "Alright, what do you want to talk about then?"

    eff "Well… I said a lot of things while yelling at my dad that I didn’t had a chance to clarify with you."

    eff "Especially since you left right in the middle of the argument which honestly might have been for the best considering how loud we got."
    scene bg apredictablerealization_6
    with dissolve
    pov "Hey, it’s no biggie."

    pov "I get you said a lot of thing in the heat of the moment and to get a reaction out of him so if you are about to tell me you didn’t mean a lot of it, I completely understand."
    scene bg apredictablerealization_5
    with dissolve
    eff "I… I meant a lot of what I said, actually."
    scene bg apredictablerealization_6
    with dissolve
    eff "Primarily the fact that you are indeed the closest thing to a boyfriend I’ve ever had."

    pov "Really?"

    eff "Oh, come on now. Is it really a surprise by this point?"
    scene bg apredictablerealization_4
    with dissolve
    eff "I think we both made our feelings pretty clear here already with everything we discussed during that previous night."
    scene bg apredictablerealization_3
    with dissolve
    pov "I mean, don’t get me wrong here. I’m happy to hear it, but…"
    scene bg apredictablerealization_5
    with dissolve
    pov "Why are you bringing it up now?"
    scene bg apredictablerealization_6
    with dissolve
    eff "Well…"
    scene bg apredictablerealization_5
    with dissolve
    eff "Because I want to make it clear that I’m serious about what I said and that I would maybe, possibly like to try to see where this is going?"

    pov "Wait what?"
    scene bg apredictablerealization_6
    with dissolve
    eff "Come on, dude. Do you really need me to spell it out for you?"

    pov "Well, it might help here a little since now I’m a little bit confused to be honest."
    scene bg apredictablerealization_4
    with dissolve
    eff "About what?"
    scene bg apredictablerealization_6
    with dissolve
    pov "Well..."

        "The timing of it all":
            scene bg apredictablerealization_3
            with dissolve
            pov "I’m just a bit confused by the timing of it all."
            scene bg apredictablerealization_6
            with dissolve
            eff "What do you mean by that?"

            pov "I mean, just before you were so adamant on not trying out formal relationships like this."
            scene bg apredictablerealization_4
            with dissolve
            pov "But now you are out of nowhere telling me you want to give it a shot?"
            scene bg apredictablerealization_3
            with dissolve
            eff "Are things moving too fast for you?"

            pov "Well, no. That isn’t really the problem here, it’s just the timing feels off for me considering you just ended a huge argument with your dad due to having me around."
            scene bg apredictablerealization_5
            with dissolve
            pov "Are you sure this is ok?"

        "You said you weren’t ready yet":
            scene bg apredictablerealization_3
            with dissolve
            pov "Mainly about the fact you time and time again told me you weren’t ready for something like this."
            pov "I mean, you made it pretty clear even when we first began seeing each other that you weren’t interested in an actual relationship outside our friendship and casual flings."
            scene bg apredictablerealization_5
            with dissolve
            eff "I- Did say that a lot yeah..."

            pov "And that night even when we did put our feelings out in the open you also did say you weren’t ready for an actual commitment."
            scene bg apredictablerealization_3
            with dissolve
            pov "And like always, I made sure to make it clear I wasn’t about to rush you either."

            eff "You certainly did… But is it really such a big shocker that I might have changed my mind?"
            scene bg apredictablerealization_4
            with dissolve
            pov "I’m just worried you might be rushing things for yourself in a way that stresses you out and makes any relationship between us too stressful for you."
            scene bg apredictablerealization_5
            with dissolve
            pov "I just wanna make sure you’ve thought things out."

    scene bg apredictablerealization_6
    with dissolve
    eff "Okay, okay. I get your point!"
    scene bg apredictablerealization_4
    with dissolve
    eff "I guess I can’t blame you for feeling confused about a lot of things about this whole thing when I’m in essentially the same boat as you."

    eff "This is all new to me and I’m just making things even more awkward."
    scene bg apredictablerealization_3
    with dissolve
    eff "Especially with the fact my Dad might have already scared you off with the way he is and the whole talk about a gun…"
    scene bg apredictablerealization_5
    with dissolve
    pov "Not at all!"
    scene bg apredictablerealization_6
    with dissolve
    eff "Really?"
    scene bg apredictablerealization_4
    with dissolve
    pov "Ok, maybe a little bit, I’m not about to try and lie to you either."
    scene bg apredictablerealization_3
    with dissolve
    pov "But what I’m trying to say is that it would take more than that to scare me off you for good."

    eff "So what’s the problem?"
    scene bg apredictablerealization_4
    with dissolve
    eff "Is it still my dad?"
    scene bg apredictablerealization_6
    with dissolve
    pov "Well, kind of?"
    scene bg apredictablerealization_5
    with dissolve
    pov "I mean, didn’t he forbid you from seeing me again in the first place?"

    eff "I don’t care if he did, I still want to see where this goes."
    scene bg apredictablerealization_3
    with dissolve
    eff "Hell, I’m not going to lie and say that the idea of him disapproving of it doesn’t make it even better either."

    pov "So you want to use me as a way to get back at your dad then?"

    pov "Date the boy he doesn’t approve of just to spite him like some teen romcom?"
    scene bg apredictablerealization_4
    with dissolve
    eff "I-"

    eff "I mean, you don’t have to see it like that."
    scene bg apredictablerealization_3
    with dissolve
    pov "Well how am I meant to see it?"
    scene bg apredictablerealization_4
    with dissolve
    eff "Look."

    eff "My dad is trying to take control of my life from me again."
    eff "Time and time again he has been the cause of me falling out with people."
    scene bg apredictablerealization_5
    with dissolve
    eff "Now, for the first time in my life, I find myself genuinely liking someone and he wants to fuck that up for me."
    scene bg apredictablerealization_4
    with dissolve
    eff "So yes, preventing him from spoiling yet another thing in my life is a reason why I’m bringing this up."
    scene bg apredictablerealization_6
    with dissolve
    eff "But the idea that you and I slowly drift apart and we lose what we have and what we may have is simply something I’m not willing to risk."
    scene bg apredictablerealization_3
    with dissolve
    eff "So if what it takes to make sure we stay together is to get out of my comfort zone, lay my claim and ask you out properly, then I’m going to be the one to take that step!"
    scene bg apredictablerealization_5
    with dissolve
    eff "Is that what you wanted to hear?!"
    scene bg apredictablerealization_4
    with dissolve
    pov "..."
    scene bg apredictablerealization_6
    with dissolve
    eff "..."
    scene bg apredictablerealization_3
    with dissolve
    eff "I Probably shouldn’t have yelled there, I’m so sorry."

    pov "It’s alright."

    eff "Oh my god, I’m so embarrassed."

    pov "Don’t be."

    pov "I’ve told you before that seeing you speak your mind like that is one of the many reasons I like you, remember?"
    scene bg apredictablerealization_4
    with dissolve
    eff "Ok, now you are just making the fact you’ve rejected me even worse by being nice to me."
    scene bg apredictablerealization_6
    with dissolve
    pov "Who said I was rejecting you?"
    scene bg apredictablerealization_5
    with dissolve
    eff "I mean, you didn’t exactly say yes either before you started questioning my motives."
    scene bg apredictablerealization_6
    with dissolve
    pov "I was just trying to figure out if you were for real or what caused the sudden change of heart."
    pov "And even if we weren’t going to start dating that doesn’t mean I would just stop hanging out with you either."

    eff "Don’t take this the wrong way but I’ve heard that before."
    eff "But you are saying what I think you are saying, right?"
    eff "Are we… An Item now?"
    scene bg apredictablerealization_5
    with dissolve
    pov "We don’t gotta put a label for it if you aren’t ready, you know?"
    pov "You can call it that way with your old man if you want, but between us we can just take it at our own pace."
    scene bg apredictablerealization_6
    with dissolve
    eff "You know what?"
    eff "I think I’d quite like that."

    #-Mc and Effie get close together as they cuddle up to one another in the bench-
    scene bg apredictablerealization_7
    with dissolve
    eff "So… what do we do now?"
    eff "What are couples even supposed to do when they first start going out, actually?"
    scene bg apredictablerealization_8
    with dissolve
    pov "Well, from what I know we could try and each plan a proper date?"
    pov "Something a little more romantic over our usual thing."
    scene bg apredictablerealization_7
    with dissolve
    eff "So… Should we each try to plan out a night out or event and just be down to do stuff together like that more often?"
    scene bg apredictablerealization_8
    with dissolve
    pov "Pretty much! How about we start small and opt for a movie to begin with?"
    pov "I heard there’s some new stuff showing this friday actually!"
    scene bg apredictablerealization_6
    with dissolve
    eff "That actually sounds like fun, maybe we could then crash at your place afterwards?"
    scene bg apredictablerealization_7
    with dissolve
    pov "It’s a date!"

    eff "Alright, that was easier than I thought!"
    eff "Pick me up at my place at 8 then."
    scene bg apredictablerealization_8
    with dissolve
    pov "What about your dad though?"

    eff "You let me worry about him, trust me on this."
    pov "Well, if you say so…"
    pov "I just hope I’m not gonna regret not investing in a bulletproof vest beforehand."

    eff "Oh shush you. It’s like I said, he mainly just has it to scare people, I doubt he would ever actually use it on someone."
    eff "I hope…"

    pov "Really not helping my nerves here, Effie."

    eff "Would our first kiss as an actual couple help settle them a bit?"
    scene bg apredictablerealization_7
    with dissolve
    pov "Only one way to find out."

    eff "Pucker up, handsome~"
