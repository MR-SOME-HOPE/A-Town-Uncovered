    show charexpression stressfultimestocome_shocked

    show charexpression stressfultimestocome_confused
    edw "It wasn’t my intention to peep or anything!"
    edw "I was kind of doing my thing with the cameras and didn’t notice them coming until they were shaking the tree with their making out!"
    edw "Luckily I managed to get away with it when I lied about being a bird watcher, they didn’t notice the camera in the trees either so that also helped my story."

    show charexpression stressfultimestocome_confused
    edw "I still used one of my spare hard drives and filled it with info about bird watching and the like. Just a quick switch to give my story more weight if Mina does come to investigate or they break their word."

    pov "It got to the point she couldn’t handle it and just stormed off in a rage."
    pov "Afterwards he went on to grill me for every little thing he has a problem with, regarding me."
