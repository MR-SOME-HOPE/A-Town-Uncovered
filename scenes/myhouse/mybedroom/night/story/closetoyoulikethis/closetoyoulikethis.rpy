    #-Scene takes place immediately after the previous scene once the player
    # clicks on their bed-

    #-Scene starts with graphic of the Mc on his bed where he is reflecting on
    # what happened during the fade to black before being joined up by Effie-

    #-The following dialogue occurs in the MC's head-

    scene black
    with fade

    pov "{i}Well, this is an interesting end of the day…{/i}"
    pov "{i}I mean, I'll have to properly ask Effie later what's going on, but at least she managed to have a good time.{/i}"
    pov "{i}I'm still worried as hell, but [sister] would absolutely kick my ass if I barge in and start making questions.{/i}"
    pov "{i}Well, guess it's a problem for morning me, though.{/i}"
    pov "{i}And of course, all of this had to happen on the one night it's my turn to do the dishes…{/i}"
    pov "{i}Took me a while to get all the extra plates too with those two giving Effie practically a full sampling of all our dishes and all, everyone's gone to bed now.{/i}"
    pov "{i}I genuinely didn't expect for them to go on for so long, but I guess they wanted to keep Effie's brain distracted as much as they could.{/i}"
    pov "{i}Guess I should just count myself lucky they didn't think on bringing the karaoke machine…{/i}"

    "{i}*Knock Knock Knock*{/i}"

    pov "Oh sweet and merciful god, please don't tell me they remembered it now!"
