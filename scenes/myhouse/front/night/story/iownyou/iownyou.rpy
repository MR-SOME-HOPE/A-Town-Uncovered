    jack "How long do you think it'll take before she hands herself in."
    jack "Because we both know she's not a mentally strong person. She's weak."

    show jack smirk_talk at right
    jack "Once it's done, I'll have something else at hand to make sure you keep quiet; but as my current deal stands, I'll erase the videos and photos once it's done."

    jack "He is going to have with him a bag of stuff, you both don't want to know about - and are not going to know about."
    jack "You'll help him load them up in a vehicle and drive off to a designated area, where you will drop the package off."
    jack "Afterwards, I want you to get rid of the vehicle and then leave the scene."
    jack "You're not going to ask questions. You're not going to talk about this, once it's done. And if the police ever question you about this; you don't even know me."
    jack "Once the job is done, I'll delete the evidence I have against you two; and you'll be free to go. Simple enough for you?"
