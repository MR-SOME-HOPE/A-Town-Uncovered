    pov "Yo, Edward, what’s up?"
    pov "Did you also get one of the Master Buukakki flyers shoved in your face today?"
    pov "Apparently these people are everywhere."

    edw "I did, [povname]. But we have more pressing matters at hand."

    pov "Uh-huh?"

    edw "Our evidence."
    edw "They’re gone."

    pov "They’re gone?"
    pov "What do you mean they’re gone?"

    edw "They’re fucking gone, [povname]."
    edw "They’re not there anymore."
    edw "The tapes, the cameras, the blueprints for my interdimensional tech, the plans."
    edw "Everything we’ve ever done related to this other dimension and Xina is g.o.n.e."
    edw "Gone."

    pov "Did you report it?"

    edw "How could I report it?"
    edw "How can I report it to the people who must’ve taken it in the first place."

    pov "You think the police is behind it?"

    edw "Bro, I think the whole FBI is."
    edw "I mean we’re dealing with some serious shit here, remember."
    edw "This isn’t a game."

    pov "Are you certain it’s the feds and not like Xina herself."
    pov "They’re separate entities, aren’t they?"

    edw "I don’t know…"
    edw "We need to meet up, dude."
    edw "We can’t go back to the hideout because I suspect that’s been compromised and bugged."
    edw "I don’t got shit anymore."

    pov "Alright, well, if we can’t go to the hideout, then we best just discuss it in detention."

    edw "Alright."

    pov "Oh- and Edward, can you tell everyone to bring their Master Buukakki flyers to detention?"
    pov "Everyone should have one, it’s literally impossible to getaway from it."
    pov "Tell them to check their front door and mailbox if they don’t have one."

    edw "*Sigh* Alright, boss."

    pov "See ya soon."
    pov "Be careful."

    edw "Watch your back too, [povname]."
