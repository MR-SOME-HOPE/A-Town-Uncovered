    pov "W-where am I?"

    edw "I know you're still in shock..."
    edw "You’ve been going in and out of it ever since we left the warehouse."
    edw "I don’t blame you though."

    jac "You’re safe now, we’re safe now."
    jac "But Effie isn’t."

    pov "Wh- where’s Effie?"
    pov "We need to go get her now!"

    edw "Whoa whoa whoaa there."

    jac "Look, I’m totally with you on that, dude."
    jac "But we need a plan first. We can’t go guns blazing willy nilly."
    jac "We’re in serious shit right now and any more fuck ups could end with more of us being taken away."

    edw "Jacob’s right, as much as it pains me to admit but we all need to discuss things and be on the same page."

    pov "What is there even to discuss?"
    pov "Effie could still be close by if we go chase after her now."
    pov "You guys don’t have to follow me but I’m going alone."
    pov "This is my fault."
