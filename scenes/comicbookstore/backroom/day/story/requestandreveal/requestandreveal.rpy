    show pov shocked_talk at left
    show jac confused at right
    pov "You used to do BMX?"
    show pov bored at left
    show jac smirk_talk at right
    jac "Yeah dude! As a kid I had big dreams to become a one of a kind bmx rider and go all over the country doing awesome tricks!"
    show jac bored_talk at right
    jac "I even had a unique twist that would set me apart from all other riders too!"
    show pov confused_talk at left
    show jac bored at right
    pov "What was that?"
    show pov confused at left
    show jac bored_talk at right
    jac "I was gonna do all my tricks blindfolded and with noise canceling headphones on to give myself a full on senses handicap and only rely on my instincts and the tactile feeling of the bike and wind around me!"
    jac "Full on relying on my third eye kind of stuff!"
    show pov bored at left
    show jac embarrassed_talk at right
    jac "Along with that, I was gonna add an assortment of other dangers to add extra spiciness to the act!"
    show pov smirk_talk at left
    show jac embarrassed at right
    pov "Huh… That sounds insane but totally believable as something you would strive out to do."
    show pov smirk at left
    show jac shocked_talk at right
    jac "I know right?!"
    jac "It was like destiny was calling my little nine year old brain."
    show pov confused_talk at left
    show jac bored at right
    pov "Why did you quit?"
    show pov confused at left
    show jac bored_talk at right
    jac "Well, while the bmx tricks were tricky on their own to learn, the blindfold and headphone part was gonna be a whole other time investment that would add years to my preparation time."
    jac "Problem was that BMX and Skateboarding were losing popularity so I had to learn fast."
    show pov shocked at left
    show jac smirk at right
    jac "So I decided to mix in all three of those learning processes in order to maximize my learning speed!"
    show pov bored_talk at left
    show jac neutral at right
    pov "Wait, so you were learning how to do BMX tricks while also learning how to ride without using your eyes or ears at the same time?!"
    show pov bored at left
    show jac neutral_talk at right
    jac "Yeah, dude!"
    jac "I mean, any idiot can learn BMX tricks and any other passionate idiot can learn to do it blindfolded, but it takes a REAL master of the craft to do it not only blindfolded, but also without relying on the sounds around them!"
    show jac smirk_talk at right
    jac "And my thought process back then was that if I learn from the beginning how to do all three steps, then I would be essentially skipping steps on my learning process for the act of my dreams!"
    show pov bored_talk at left
    show jac smirk at right
    pov "…"
    pov "Wow, Jacob…"
    show pov bored at left
    show jac smirk_talk at right
    jac "I know, right? Even back then I’ve always had a full-on-efficiency Mindset, bro!"
    jac "I even decided to tackle half-pipe tricks as my first learning trick as those were the ones I was most excited to learn and were always the most extravagant with my setup."

    show jac neutral at right
    pov "I’ll guess that’s when you took the blow to the head?"
    show pov smirk at left
    show jac embarrassed_talk at right
    jac "Woke up in the hospital three days later with a massive headache."
    jac "Doctors said I was lucky to be alive somewhere else and Dad took my blindfold and headphone set up and forbid me to ride a bike with anything covering my eyes or ears."
    show pov smirk_talk at left
    show jac embarrassed at right
    pov "Probably the responsible parent thing to do."
    show pov embarrassed_talk at left
    show jac neutral at right
    pov "Well, I’m sorry your BMX dreams died there, Jacob."
    show pov embarrassed at left
    show jac neutral_talk at right
    jac "Oh, well they didn’t die there exactly."
    jac "Since I couldn’t do the blindfold trick anymore, I resorted to try different kinds of acts in order to try to recover the gimmick to make me stand out."
    show jac embarrassed_talk at right
    jac "It was when I tried to do tricks while being set on fire that my Dad decided to take my BMX bike away from me."
    show pov neutral_talk at left

    jac "He doesn’t let me get my drivers license for that same reason actually."
    jac "But anyway, after that big blow to my head and many others that came from similar adventures, a bunch of those days are kinda fuzzy to me, you know?"
    show pov shocked at left
    show jac embarrassed_talk at right
    jac "Effie usually helps me remember that sort of stuff."

    show pov bored at left
    show jac bored_talk at right
    jac "But if you are dating a mermaid, you owe me an introduction to one of her similarly hot mermaid friends."
    show jac shocked_talk at right

    show jac confused_talk at right
    jac "That’s the sort of stuff you are borderline expected of when you become bro’s with someone."
