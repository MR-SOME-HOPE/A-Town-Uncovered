    show hit embarrassed_talk at right
    hit "I can confirm that what Effie let out that time, was one hundred percent true, and it seems I got my wish."
    show pov confused_talk at left
    show hit embarrassed at right

    show pov confused at left
    show hit confused_talk at right
    hit "I mean… Is it wrong to admit it now?"
    show pov embarrassed at left
    show hit embarrassed_talk at right

    show pov neutral_talk at left
    show hit confused at right
    pov "Not at all. In fact, I’m quite flattered, honestly."
    show pov neutral at left
    show hit smirk_talk at right
    hit "I’m really relieved, because it makes tackling the topic I was trying to tell you about last time much easier."
    show pov confused_talk at left
    show hit shocked at right
    pov "Right. The proposal you were telling me about, before your sketchbook went flying…"
    show pov shocked at left
    show hit embarrassed_talk at right
    hit "Yes, that one…"
    hit "How would you feel… if you modeled with me next time?"
    show pov confused_talk at left
    show hit embarrassed at right
    pov "Uhh… wasn’t I already doing that?"
    show pov smirk at left
    show hit smirk_talk at right
    hit "Hehehe, no silly!"
    hit "Currently you are modeling FOR me. I’m asking if you would model WITH me."
    show pov neutral at left
    show hit confused_talk at right
    hit "As in… with me instead of Effie…"
    show hit shocked_talk at right
    hit "For my next volume, I have a character that is more to my own body’s dimensions rather than Effie’s, so I could use the extra reference."
    show pov neutral_talk at left
    show hit confused at right
    pov "Oooohh, yeah, of course!"
    show pov smirk_talk at left
    pov "Wait… If you are also modeling, how are you gonna capture all the weird angles you need?"
    show pov smirk at left
    show hit neutral_talk at right
    hit "That’s where the real proposal comes up…"
    show hit smirk_talk at right
    hit "You see, I’ve managed to make some space back in my apartment. So we won’t be interrupted there. And I had the idea of using a camera to capture the poses I need. So I can cross reference them later!"
    show hit neutral_talk at right
    hit "That way I won’t have you hold the same pose for a super long time while I sketch it."
    show pov smirk_talk at left
    show hit neutral at right
    pov "That sounds like a great idea!"
    show pov embarrassed_talk at left
    show hit confused at right
    pov "Actually… I’m kind of surprised it took us this long to figure it out…"
    show pov shocked at left
    show hit embarrassed_talk at right
    hit "W-Well, back then it was my first time doing proper drawing using a model, and I felt like using a camera would defeat the purpose of having a live model, you know?"
    show pov confused at left
    show hit neutral_talk at right
    hit "But now that I want to use myself as a reference, I don’t really have a choice in the matter. So I’m willing to try it out now!"
    show pov embarrassed_talk at left
    show hit confused at right
    pov "I guess that’s a fair enough reason…"
    show pov neutral_talk at left
    show hit embarrassed at right

    show pov neutral at left
    show hit neutral_talk at right
    hit "Great! There’s just one problem though…"
    hit "My phone’s camera absolutely sucks and I need the best quality images possible. Not to mention I don’t have any way to control the lighting…"
    show pov neutral_talk at left
    show hit confused at right
    pov "How can I help?"
    show pov neutral at left
    show hit confused_talk at right
    hit "Well, if you could manage to get me a good camera and lighting kit, I would be able to set it all up just how I need it, back in my apartment."
    show pov confused_talk at left
    show hit confused at right
    pov "A camera and some lights?"
    pov "Well… I’ll see what I can do…"
    show pov confused at left
    show hit neutral_talk at right
    hit "I know this is a really big ask, but if I had them, I would be able to properly setup a space at my place for us to model comfortably without bouncing from place to place."
    show pov shocked at left
    show hit embarrassed_talk at right
    hit "N-Not to mention… we could also do the more extreme poses Effie and you tried out as well, anytime I’d need some reference material…"
    show pov embarrassed_talk at left
    show hit embarrassed at right
    pov "I-Is that so?"
    show pov smirk_talk at left
    pov "Well, I definitely want to keep helping expand your reference library… I’ll get right on it, then."
    show pov embarrassed at left
    show hit smirk_talk at right
    hit "G-Great! Well, I’ll have everything ready, so just let me know when you can get the things and we can set a date!"
    show pov neutral_talk at left
    show hit neutral at right
    pov "Of course. Well, I better get going, then."
    pov "See you soon, Hitomi."
