    #-This scene consists of a major event that will serve as as introduction to a future event in the final confrontation with Lashley, during his conversation with “Nice Personality Friend” the player will have to bring up topics in order to keep the conversation going and distracting her enough for Jacob to do their “Magic” on the hotter friend. The player will have to correctly pick the topic for conversation at least two times in order to get a good result, but regardless of whether or not #they manage to successfully distract her, the Mc will inevitably switch places with Ian at the last second in order to free himself from the awkward girl, who he will be infinitely more compatible. After that, the mc receives a call from Lashley to meet outside and the scene goes on-

    #-Every correct answer will have her sprite move closer to the Mc while every mistake will move her closer, neutral answers will keep her in place-

    #-Scene starts with Mc and Jacob in the final stages of reciting the wingman’s oath, but after this very important yet unnecessary step, the party has started so now Jacob and Mc will have to improvise-
