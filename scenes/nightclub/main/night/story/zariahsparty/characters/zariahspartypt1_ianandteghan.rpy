    #-cru is currently comparing Teghan to a character from the popular porn comics series (with plot) known as “The Epic of Lady Opala”, Teghan is faking being upset by it (though not entirely faking it) in order to teach cru a lesson on Nerd to Non-Nerd interactions and get him off her case for the night without making him feel worse about it-
