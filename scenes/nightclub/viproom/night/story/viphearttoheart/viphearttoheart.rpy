    #-Mc enters the VIP area to meet up with Hitomi. Once past the curtains, he
    # sees two rows of private boots each divided by thin velvety walls that kept
    # what happens in said booths as private from the rest as possible. He can
    # see Hitomi in one of the booths closest to the entrance with a clear view
    # of it-

    #-Mc approaches Hitomi who is sitting by herself looking nervous-
