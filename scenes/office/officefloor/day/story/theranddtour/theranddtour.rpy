    elo "[povname], meet the real reason I’m so passionate about my work."
    elo "My real pièce de résistance and my life's work!"
    elo "The 'Everyday Robotics' Department!"

    #-Scene now has Eloise and the MC enter a white observation room overlooking a
    # private lab, in this lab there is a large variety of prototype humanoid robots
    # in a semi/half-built state with no real human features aside from their overall
    # silhouettes and shape while holding a variety of poses with everyday objects
    # like cleaning something with a feather duster or on a simulated drivers seat
    # holding a steering wheel or a nurse robot holding a medicine tray or first
    # aid kit. Maybe have a few more shots of other robots in similar everyday
    # situations to showcase the variety of situations Eloise is preparing this
    # robots for?-
    #-The mc looks shocked at the view while Eloise has a proud smile while looking
    # down at her babies-

    pov "W-what the hell is all of this?!"
    elo "Uh… I just told you?"
    elo "It’s the 'Everyday Robotics' Department."
    pov "N-No, I mean."
    scene bg theranddtour_3_1
    pov "I get that part, but I thought you said you weren't making 'Sex Bots'?"
    elo "And we aren’t."
    elo "Such a move would be met with a massive amount of backlash from the general consumer we are trying to orient these kinds of units for."
    elo "In this department, we are working to capture a more human side of our robotic pursuits and bring to the public a revolution in technology similar to what the era of smartphones brought!"
    elo "Robotic companions capable of a wide variety of tasks around a typical home, for the ease of the consumer!"
    pov "Wasn’t there a movie that had a similar idea for robots, only for it to end badly for us humans?"
    elo "Quite many. But come on, [povname]."
    elo "That was a movie based on a book, there is no way such a thing would happen in real life."
    elo "Especially with how paranoid humanity has become of such a thing happening in the first place, thanks to those movies."
    elo "Besides, it’s not like we are messing with artificial intelligence or the like, which I would like to remind you is the actual cause of most robot uprisings in science fiction."
    elo "These line of robots actually use a similar Virtual Intelligence network similar to Evie back upstairs."
    elo "They are programmed to simply follow a path of logic corresponding with their task while using a personality module to simulate human emotion and responses."
    elo "They don’t really think and just stick to their specific function."
    scene bg theranddtour_2
    pov "So, like with the example you told me back at your office, you are basically improving the tech and giving a functioning body to the virtual assistant of a smartphone?"
    elo "Exactly, [povname], exactly!"
    elo "Although, I would still say it’s a bit more than that."
    elo "At least for now, I’m not looking to expand this sort of technology to the general market, but introduce it as a tool to help people in need."
    elo "I imagine a world where these robots are out there, driving people who can’t drive by themselves, to work or to visit their doctors."
    elo "Or have them collect information on patients and deliver them their respective medicine in quarantine areas without risking the health of human nurses and doctors."
    elo "Or for them to allow people to have a trusted caretaker for their elderly when they aren’t capable of doing stuff on their own anymore, all while the robot provides them and their doctors with a constant and thorough monitoring of their condition and changes in their health…"
    pov "That last one was oddly specific."
    elo "Well, that’s because that was the initial idea that sparked me into making this whole department in the first place."
    pov "Oh… I’m so sorry, I didn’t mean to bring up anything sensitive."
    elo "Oh, no no no. You are fine, really."
    elo "I was the one who brought it up in the first place, after all."
    elo "I don’t mind at all."
    pov "So… You are doing this because of…"
    elo "My father, yes."
    elo "He died quite some time ago now."
    pov "I’m really sorry for your loss."
    elo "It’s fine, I’m quite over it. I still appreciate your sentiment though, thank you."
    elo "He suddenly became violently ill with some kind of disease. Not even doctors could figure out what to do or how to help him."
    elo "His body and condition seemed fine when we were looking over him, but as soon as he spent some time without supervision, it’s like he suddenly got worse."
    elo "It didn’t help, the fact that he wasn’t a fan of hospitals and refused to spend more than a few days at a time there."
    pov "Sounds like it was a horrible situation."
    elo "It really was."
    elo "My sister and I were making our lives out of town, but we dropped everything and rushed back to take care of him."
    pov "He was lucky to have you."
    elo "Yeah, I don’t think so…"
    elo "To tell you the truth, I hadn’t spoken to him or Lashley ever since I left town for college… It made things really awkward at the beginning."
    pov "How come?"
    elo "It’s… A long story. I don’t want to get into the details right now."
    elo "My point is that, even with Lashley and I here and the family fortune at our disposal, we still weren’t enough to help him get better."
    elo "We needed to sleep or eat or take care of other business, so there were plenty of times that he had to stay on his own and that's when his symptoms kicked in."
    elo "And hired caretakers were out of the question, after we found one of them trying to steal from us…"
    elo "Which is when I had the idea for this type of robot."
    elo "A caretaker who could have looked after my father 24/7 and diagnosed his symptoms, on those tiny windows of time where he was on his own."
    elo "Who had the medical knowledge to help him, on the spot, while also taking in-depth notes of his condition and even let us know so we could rush him to the hospital or at least rush in to help treat him as well."
    pov "That’s a really noble idea, Eloise."
    elo "Thank you, [povname]. "
    elo "After some time working on the idea, it eventually evolved into all that you see here; Evie included."
    elo "Helper robots for various tasks, all aimed at the elderly or people with disabilities who require the assistance."
    elo "It’s been my dream, and I feel like we get closer to it every day."
    pov "Why keep it a secret, then? I’m sure a lot of people share that same kind of dream."
    elo "Investors and the board members against me definitely aren't among that sector of people."
    elo "They only care about what brings the most profit and don’t see the monumental humanitarian aid this project could bring to the world."
    elo "But then again, my family comes from old money, and I doubt that my ancestors made their fortune from charity and selfless work."
    pov "That’s the capitalist way, I guess."
    elo "It ain’t perfect but I wouldn’t live by any other system, you know?"
    elo "Anyway, until I can really bring a working prototype to showcase to investors in tosee sectors I'm after or to get the board members against me off my back, I have to keep this whole operation a secret from most people."
    elo "Evie was a step in the right direction but is still very limited on what she can do, especially for the level of tasks I'm trying to get them to be capable of performing."
    elo "At the rate we are going, it could take years before we make a substantial advancement in the field. So I'm forced to approve other projects and explore loopholes to keep the investors happy and the board off my back."
    pov "Things like the alarm system for the town, I presume."
    elo "The loopholes we are gonna be able to exploit in the future because of it will be very beneficial for the company, aside from tax related issues."
    elo "But there's no need to bore you to death with the legal details."
    elo "For now, I just wanted to show you all of this."
    pov "I'm… well, I'm rather blown away, to be honest, here, Eloise. "
    pov "I don't really have any words."
    elo "You don't need to say anything, [povname]. I'm showing you this as a sign of trust, considering I have you working for me behind the scenes now."
    elo "So just feel excited for the future I'm trying to create here and know that if you keep proving your worth, you may just be rewarded for it in many different ways."
    pov "Like what?"
    elo "Further sneak-peeks at my projects, perhaps a little cash incentive for your studies…"
    elo "Or perhaps something more… physical… if you play your cards just right."
    elo "Do you get what I'm saying?"
    pov "I-I think I get the picture, yeah."
    elo "Good!"
    elo "I want to remind you that: whatever I want, I get."
    elo "If there is someone who helps me get what I want, I make sure they are very handsomely rewarded."
    elo "And I can be very creative with the way I reward people who are of use to me…"
    elo "So be a good boy and don't disappoint me."
    pov "I'm still not entirely sure just what exactly it is you want my help with."
    elo "And even so, you still managed to prove your worth by telling me of this little inspection on our problem department that was scheduled behind my back."
    elo "Which earned you a peek on the project I've practically dedicated my life to."
    elo "The only people who know of this project are me, my head engineers and their underlings, working exclusively for the project."
    elo "And all of them are under a beyond strict confidentiality contract that would hit them with the full weight of the law and the many political connections we have at our disposal."
    elo "You however, aren't."
    pov "Are you not afraid I may spill the beans about the whole thing?"
    elo "[povname], you are an intern working for a department of tech support."
    elo "Who is ever going to believe your story that the CEO of an extremely large robotics company took an interest in you."
    elo "Asked you to work as her spy in said tech support department, and rewarded you by taking you to an underground lab to show you an ultra secret department of helper robots?"
    pov "OK, I see your point."
    elo "The reason I'm comfortable sharing this stuff with you is because no one would ever take your word seriously."
    pov "Harsh, but I guess I can't blame you for it."
    elo "Don't take it the wrong way! I'm really glad to be able to talk to you and show you all of this."
    elo "Honestly, I've been dying to show this to someone outside of the department."
    elo "Every artist always wants to show off their creation, you know? But it's way too early for me to showcase it properly."
    pov "Well, I'm honored you showed me then."
    elo "Alright, let's get going. I think I've kept you down here for far too long now."
    scene bg theranddtour_3_1
    elo "The last part of our little tour will likely take an entire one of your shifts, so I'll have to come up with an excuse to take you out of the office for it."
    elo "Still, I don't want it to affect the productivity of your department too much."
    elo "Send me a text whenever you feel you have time for it, and I'll make the arrangements."
    elo "Just make sure to do so a few days in advance, to give me time to set things up."
    pov "Alright, definitely something I can do."
    elo "Good! Now let's get out of here."
