    show pov embarrassed_talk at left
    pov "And you did tell me this last tour was gonna take a good chunk of the day, so I figured we could get through it as early as possible, right?"

    show elo neutral_talk at right
    elo "I certainly appreciate your punctuality, then!"
    show pov confused at left
    show elo embarrassed_talk at right
    elo "Though I was certainly surprised that you wanted to have this tour on the same day as the inspection for the rest of your team."
    show pov shocked_talk at left
    show elo confused at right
    pov "I hope I'm not messing with your plans regarding that part."
    show pov shocked at left
    show elo shocked_talk at right
    elo "Oh, not at all!"
    show elo embarrassed at right
    elo "I just had to give a quick peek into your office on the way here."
    show pov embarrassed at left
    elo "The inspectors were ready to lay into the department, but as soon as they saw me, they knew the jig was up."
    show elo smirk_talk at right
    elo "I made sure they understood I now had my eye on them and their reports. Little weasels nearly tried to run with their tails between their legs when they realized how aware I was of this off-routine inspection."
    show pov neutral_talk at left
    show elo smirk at right
    pov "Man, I would have paid to see their reactions!"
    show pov neutral at left
    show elo shocked_talk at right
    elo "Oh, they were absolutely hysterical, [povname]!"
    show elo smirk_talk at right
    elo "Especially when I let them know I was gonna be doing a secondary inspection myself, using their notes, right after their own inspection."
    show pov embarrassed at left
    show elo shocked_talk at right
    elo "That should keep them from exaggerating in their words and their issues with their reports too much, now that they know I'll be looking over them right away."
    show elo smirk_talk at right
    elo "That alone should improve your team's chances for a passable review for the board."
    show pov embarrassed_talk at left
    show elo smirk at right
    pov "You are certain they won't try to lie or over exaggerate, despite all that?"
    show pov confused at left
    show elo bored_talk at right
    elo "They may try, if they are brave or stupid enough."
    show elo confused_talk at right
    elo "The whole company is well aware of how much I hate when people lie to my face - especially when it's an employee."
    show elo bored_talk at right
    elo "Those two are low enough on the food chain for such an action to be a reason for them to be fired, so they'll tread as carefully as they can in order to come up with issues for their reports."
    show pov embarrassed at left
    elo "Their manager has already been informed that he is on thin fucking ice for scheduling a surprise inspection without filing proper procedure and informing his superiors, or rather {b}me{/b} in this case, of such a thing."
    show elo neutral_talk at right
    elo "That should do the trick to keep them out of your hair in the future."
    show pov smirk_talk at left
    show elo neutral at right
    pov "Damn, you are going all in on this, aren't you?"
    show pov embarrassed at left
    show elo smirk_talk at right
    elo "If you mess with the best, you die like the rest~"
    show elo neutral_talk at right
    elo "Plus, once I do my separate inspection, the little backstabbers are gonna be so scared of any repercussions, that they won't say anything if I downright remove some of their complaints or am more lenient towards your department's shortcomings."
    elo "I took a good look at the place, and I must say: I'm really impressed with what your department has managed to do so far."
    show pov confused at left
    show elo shocked_talk at right
    elo "Especially under the extra pressure of this inspection!"
    show pov embarrassed at left
    show elo bored_talk at right
    elo "Sure, there are a few areas that need polishing up, but I see a lot of promise and good people working there."
    show elo smirk_talk at right
    elo "What else can you ask for, as a boss?"
    show pov embarrassed_talk at left
    show elo smirk at right
    pov "I'm definitely glad to have you on our side, then."
    show pov neutral_talk at left
    pov "And I'm especially glad that I decided to tell you in good time about this inspection in the first place."
    show pov neutral at left
    show elo neutral_talk at right
    elo "I told you that you made the right choice when siding up with me!"
    show pov smirk_talk at left
    show elo neutral at right
    pov "You also didn't give me much of a choice."
    show pov smirk at left
    show elo shocked_talk at right
    elo "Don't focus so much on the details on who has more power over who. Or how much leverage over you I have!"
    show pov confused at left
    show elo neutral_talk at right
    elo "Focus on the good parts like how well things are looking up for your team!"
    elo "Once we finish up with your tour, I'll make sure to make this whole nightmare for your team; into quite the pleasant dream."
    show elo confused_talk at right
    elo "I have the power to make a mediocre review, like the one those two weasels are making, into an outstandingly positive one that shows the promise of your team and the department!."
    show pov embarrassed at left
    show elo smirk_talk at right
    elo "You just let me work my magic~"
    show pov embarrassed_talk at left

    show pov embarrassed at left
    show elo neutral_talk at right
    elo "Good!"
    show pov shocked at left
    show elo confused_talk at right
    elo "Back on topic though, I'm really surprised you are willing to do all this on your day off."
    show elo embarrassed_talk at right
    elo "Even I can see how annoying it is to work on such a day."
    show pov embarrassed_talk at left
    show elo confused at right
    pov "W-Well, I don't really know when I'm gonna have another opportunity once things go back to normal in the department."
    show pov embarrassed at left
    show elo confused_talk at right
    elo "I thought you were only a part time intern, though?"
    show pov confused_talk at left
    show elo shocked at right
    pov "Well, yeah. But we do have a bunch of higher-ups working against us to the point of scheming behind our backs like this."
    show pov bored_talk at left
    pov "You never know when I'll be asked to work extra hard due to another of their plans threatening the department, you know?"
    show pov smirk_talk at left
    pov "I figured it smart to get it out the way ASAP rather than wait for the next opportunity, you know?"
    show pov smirk at left
    show elo bored_talk at right
    elo "Hmmm… I certainly see your point…"
    show elo confused_talk at right
    elo "I'll definitely have to come up with something to make sure you guys are as immune to these sorts of tricks as possible."
    show elo shocked_talk at right
    elo "Wouldn't be surprised if they tried to overwork all of you until you broke down and quit - after this attempt of theirs fails."
    show pov neutral at left
    show elo embarrassed_talk at right
    elo "Once again, you brought another thing to my attention and likely prevented disaster, [povname]. Remind me to reward you once we have more time~"
    show pov neutral_talk at left
    show elo embarrassed at right
    pov "I'll certainly keep it in mind."
    pov "Though you really don't need to do that. I'm happy with you just looking out for us."
    show pov neutral at left
    show elo smirk_talk at right
    elo "My, my~"
    elo "Keep that up, and I just might reward you, right here and now~"
    show pov embarrassed at left
    show elo neutral_talk at right
    elo "Or at least I'd consider it, if we had enough time."
    show elo embarrassed_talk at right
    elo "We do need to get to the tour, in order for me to then go do the second inspection and let everyone go home as early as possible."
    show elo confused_talk at right
    elo "Perhaps I'll even give them the day off tomorrow so they can rest up properly - after what must have been a really crazy weekend."
    show pov neutral_talk at left
    show elo smirk at right
    pov "I'm sure they would consider you a saint for that. It was beyond hectic trying to prepare for this. And I don't want to imagine how bad it must have been over the weekend."
    show pov embarrassed at left
    show elo smirk_talk at right
    elo "I shall do that, then!"
    elo "You are really proving your worth as my cute little informant~"
    show pov smirk_talk at left
    show elo smirk at right
    pov "Heh, I'm just looking out for the team and our agreement."
    show pov embarrassed at left
    show elo smirk_talk at right
    elo "Do keep at it, I like a man who is both useful and dedicated~"
    show pov neutral at left
    show elo shocked_talk at right
    elo "Alright, so let me explain how this is going to go down."
    show elo neutral_talk at right
    elo "The warehouse is divided into three major areas."
    elo "The Parking Lot for our trucks and cargo."
    show elo confused_talk at right
    elo "The Embarking and Disembarking area where we either, move items into the factory area, or from it to be sent to storage."
    show pov shocked at left
    show elo neutral_talk at right
    elo "And finally, the actual Warehouses: where we store things such as raw materials, equipment of several types, finished projects that are moving to a testing phase, and independent laboratories and testing areas where we conduct further research on specific projects."
    show pov embarrassed_talk at left
    show elo neutral_talk at right
    pov "Quite a lot of space, then."
    show pov embarrassed at left
    show elo neutral_talk at right
    elo "We do end up with a lot of things that need storage, you know?"
    show elo smirk_talk at right
    elo "Best to do so in-house."
    show pov confused at left
    show elo shocked_talk at right
    elo "Now, obviously we can't really go into detail about any of these warehouses, but I can give you a bit of a run-through of the non secretive projects while we drive around."
    show pov confused_talk at left
    show elo neutral at right
    pov "Drive around?"
    show pov confused at left
    show elo neutral_talk at right
    elo "Of course! Naturally such a big space would be a pain to walk around in, for a quick tour, and I'm not about to ruin my high-heels, just like that!"
    show elo shocked_talk at right
    elo "The Warehouse has available golf-type carts, for higher end employees to roam around in the area."
    show pov shocked at left
    show elo confused_talk at right
    elo "They are only supposed to be used for transportation but I assure you that it's quite fun to drive them around~"
    show pov neutral_talk at left
    show elo smirk at right
    pov "Neat. Sounds like it's gonna be a much more entertaining tour, then!"
    show pov neutral at left
    show elo neutral_talk at right
    elo "It's definitely the part I've been looking forward to the most!"
    show pov confused at left
    show elo embarrassed_talk at right
    elo "I'm not ashamed to admit to you that I love those little things. They are our own patented design too, which only sweetens the deal even more so for me!"
    show pov embarrassed at left
    show elo neutral_talk at right
    elo "Well then, shall we be off?"
    show pov neutral_talk at left
    show elo neutral at right
    pov "By all means, ladies first!"
    show pov neutral at left
    show elo smirk_talk at right
    elo "Such a gentleman~"
    show pov embarrassed at left
    elo "I might just be convinced to give you the promised reward by letting you drive one for a bit!"
    show pov shocked at left
    show elo neutral_talk at right
    elo "That is, unless you would prefer for a more… Carnal… type of reward from me~"
    show pov shocked_talk at left
    show elo smirk at right
    pov "I-I um…"
    show pov embarrassed at left
    show elo neutral_talk at right
    elo "Oh how I adore making you flustered!"
    show pov shocked at left
    show elo smirk_talk at right
    elo "Relax a little - I'm obviously just messing with you!"
    show pov shocked_talk at left
    show elo smirk at right
    pov "R-Right… Of course. Sorry about that."
    show pov embarrassed at left
    show elo shocked_talk at right
    elo "I obviously cannot allow an intern to drive a company vehicle without him getting the specific clearance to do so!"
    show pov confused at left
    show elo smirk_talk at right
    elo "It would be entirely against company rules and safety regulations."
    show pov shocked at left
    show elo neutral_talk at right
    elo "So that means we'll have to go to plan B for your reward!"
    show pov shocked_talk at left

    show elo confused at right

    show elo smirk_talk at right

    show elo smirk at right
    pov "Y-Yeah, I know that, but-"
    show pov confused at left
    show elo neutral_talk at right
    elo "We can discuss that other thing later."

    show elo smirk_talk at right
