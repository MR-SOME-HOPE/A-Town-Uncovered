## Eloise At The Control
label lbl_eloise_at_the_control:
    ## MC accidentally stumbles upon the surveillance room rather than the server room that they were searching for.

    ## At the console table, is Eloise. Not Xina. She’s hunched over it feeling like this is all her fault. She didn’t do anything but simply having all these androids were enough to make her be responsible. That’s all anyone and everyone is gonna think.

    ## She’s absolutely distraught and defeated. She tried stopping the attack herself but can’t get it to work. She believes someone has hacked into her system and initiated the invasion.
