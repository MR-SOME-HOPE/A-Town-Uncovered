    xin "First he fucks up our ceremony."
    xin "Then I tried to be good to him and turn him to our side."
    xin "And he fucks that up too!"
    xin "His one action alone has caused a snowball effect and set us back by years."
    xin "Decades even!"
    xin "How can we invade and control a whole ‘nother universe if I can’t even control this one man?!"
    xin "{i}*Mocking voice*{/i} Oh- but why can’t you just destroy him?"
    xin "{i}*Mocking voice*{/i} Why can’t you kidnap him?"

    xin "Is that right?"
    xin "I mean, I don’t blame you."
    xin "You can believe something about yourself one day and then do a 180 and realize the opposite."
    xin "Like me."
    xin "I believed I was crazy for the longest time."
    xin "And then I woke up, and everyone who called me crazy were the crazy ones."
    xin "I’ve been sane all this time, just because everyone else didn’t believe what I believe."
    xin "Doesn’t mean, I’m wrong."
    xin "They just don’t see the potential yet."
