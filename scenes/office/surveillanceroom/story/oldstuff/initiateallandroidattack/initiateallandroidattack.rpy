    ## Shot of Xina’s fingers on the keyboard typing away

    ## Shot of screen with a passcode entered

    ## INITIATE ALL ANDROID ATTACK says the screen.

    xin "Execute."

    ## A shot of the warehouse full of VI Androids and their eyes glow red to indicate they’ve all switched on.

    "All VIs" "Understood."

    ## Shot of the office building and its warehouse and all the VI androids bursting through the roof and flying out of it like a swarm of wasps.

    ## They fly everywhere in the sky and go into zombie mode.
    ## One of them flies at the camera and it suddenly goes black to fade into the next scene.

    ## SCENE ENDS
