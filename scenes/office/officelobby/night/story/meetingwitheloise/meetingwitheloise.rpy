    pov "Let’s hope they don’t say anything to the old man…"

    pov "No, nothing like that. Everyone is great, for the most part!"
    pov "It’s just that our manager caught wind that the higher ups-are gonna be sending people for a surprise inspection on Monday, so we have to get everything set up as fast as possible before that."

    show elo confused_talk at right
    elo "That’s odd, this is the first time I’ve heard anything about a surprise inspection."
    show pov confused at left
    show elo embarrassed_talk at right
    elo "Us in higher management tend to schedule them in secret. And according to what I know, the next one isn’t until next month, so you guys had time to get yourselves set up."

    show elo embarrassed at right
    pov "Well, I don’t know what to tell you, then."
    show pov embarrassed_talk at left
    pov "Maybe whoever gave my manager the heads-up is playing a prank on us or they heard the rumor wrong."
    show pov embarrassed_talk at left
    show elo confused_talk at right
    elo "Perhaps…"
    show pov embarrassed at left
    show elo shocked_talk at right
    elo "Or maybe, the higher-ups against me are trying to pull a fast one on me by doing this inspection without my knowledge, so they can start making strikes on the department as a whole!"

    show elo confused at right
    pov "That’s a little dramatic, don’t you think?"
    show pov smirk at left
    show elo confused_talk at right
    elo "The corporate world is filled with this kind of scheming, [povname]."
    show pov shocked at left
    show elo shocked_talk at right
    elo "And considering that the failure of the department would reflect bad on me, as the one spearheading the project, it’s likely a way for them to also start their coup against me!"

    show elo confused_talk at right
    elo "Oh, that bunch of conniving bastards are going to pay for this!"

    pov "What are you planning to do?"
    show pov confused at left
    show elo angry_talk at right
    elo "Oh, I’ll flood their respective departments with such a high influx of work that they won’t even have time to go to the bathroom!"
    show elo shocked_talk at right
    elo "If anything, just to prevent them from trying anything like this for a while."
    show pov embarrassed at left
    show elo bored_talk at right
    elo "But first of all, I’ll have to deal with the inspection… When did you hear it was scheduled for?"
    show pov confused_talk at left
    show elo bored at right
    pov "Monday morning, apparently."
    show pov confused at left
    show elo bored_talk at right
    elo "We never do inspections that early unless we are planning to do a deep dive on it…"
    show elo smirk_talk at right
    elo "The sons of bitches are more than likely going to be combing the entire floor, looking for every single thing out of place, for them to write a complaint about for their bosses."
    show pov bored_talk at left
    show elo bored at right
    pov "If they are that thorough, I don’t think there's much we can do to brace ourselves for it. Even with the overtime everyone is putting up, we are still no way ready to receive such an inspection!"
    show pov confused at left
    show elo bored_talk at right
    elo "You let me worry about that."
    show pov shocked at left
    show elo angry_talk at right
    elo "I ain’t gonna let those bastards pull a fast one on me like that, without me fighting back!"
    show elo smirk_talk at right
    elo "Especially now that I have you as my little trap-card, feeding me information behind their back as well~"
    show pov confused at left
    show elo shocked_talk at right
    elo "Not even a full week in and you are already proving your worth, with your end of the deal. I’m impressed!"
    show pov confused_talk at left
    show elo smirk at right
    pov "Well, I just don’t want the guys in the department to suffer from being caught in the crossfire of your war with the other higher-ups."
    pov "If by doing that I also get to help you out, then that’s just a chance for all of us to win, huh?"
    show pov confused at left
    show elo smirk_talk at right
    elo "I like the way you are speaking."
    elo "And don’t worry, it’s in my best interests for your department to succeed, so we’ll have to work together to make sure that happens."
    show pov shocked at left
    show elo neutral_talk at right
    elo "But enough about that. Ready for the next part of our tour?"
    show pov embarrassed_talk at left
    show elo neutral at right
    pov "This time it’s the Research & Development Department, right?"
    show pov embarrassed at left
    show elo neutral_talk at right
    elo "Yep!"
    elo "This should be a considerably faster tour, considering we won’t be stepping down on the actual work floor and I don’t need to give you the full guided experience that we give for the interns who are actually assigned to the area."
    show pov shocked at left
    show elo smirk_talk at right
    elo "No, you are going to get to experience the VIP tour we give investors and potential business partners."
    show pov embarrassed at left
    show elo neutral at right
    elo "Way faster and a lot more fun than sitting in a conference room for an hour discussing safety procedures before the actual tour."
    show pov neutral_talk at left
    show elo neutral at right
    pov "Sounds good to me. I just spent all day running around the office, so I could use a bit of an easier tour of the place."
    show pov confused_talk at left
    pov "But won’t it cause problems if people see me walking around with you?"
    show pov confused at left
    show elo neutral_talk at right
    elo "No need to worry. For the VIP tours we actually have designed a bit of a showcase hallway above the workfloor that goes around and overlooks the different areas. We can look out but they can’t look in, to prevent them from being distracted by people passing by in the hallway."
    show pov shocked at left
    show elo smirk_talk at right
    elo "Plus, the whole R&D department is actually underground and I can monitor who is in and out of the area from my office and by now most people should be gone so we can sneak by without a problem."
    show pov shocked_talk at left
    show elo embarrassed at right
    pov "You guys have an underground lab?!"
    show pov shocked at left
    show elo smirk_talk at right
    elo "Keeps prying eyes away and we ran out of workspace in the surrounding area to expand."
    show pov smirk_talk at left
    show elo smirk at right
    pov "Alright, a little “supervillain-esque”, but I guess that makes sense?"
    show pov smirk at left
    show elo neutral_talk at right
    elo "The observational area even has a conveyor belt, so you don’t have to walk as you get the tour."
    elo "I ride it every morning with a cup of coffee and just watch people start their day in the different projects, it’s pretty satisfying!"
    show pov neutral_talk at left
    show elo smirk at right
    pov "Fancy!"
    show pov embarrassed_talk at left
    show elo neutral at right
    pov "Though still with a bit of a “Supervillain” vibe."

    elo "Once you get a taste of power in this corporate world, [povname], you’ll do anything to never let it go."
    show elo neutral_talk at right
    elo "And that’s how you move up in this kind of business."
    show pov embarrassed_talk at left
    show elo neutral at right
    pov "I keep getting a lot of advice on how this “corporate world” is and I keep wondering how people do this every day."
    show pov embarrassed at left
    show elo neutral_talk at right
    elo "Tenacity, something to help you cope, and a willingness to take opportunities to meet the right people."
    show pov neutral at left
    show elo smirk_talk at right
    elo "But enough of work talk, let’s get started before it gets even later. I have something to show you by the end!"
    show pov smirk_talk at left
    show elo neutral at right
    pov "You do?"
    show pov embarrassed at left
    show elo neutral_talk at right
    elo "It’s a surprise!"
    show elo smirk_talk at right
    elo "I think you earned it, with that bit of information about this surprise inspection people were planning to have behind my back."
    show pov neutral at left
    show elo neutral_talk at right
    elo "Now come on, we start with the automotive R&D department first. And go down the list to finish with the aerospace one!"

    pov "Neat!"
