    eff "[povname]! We found your parents tied up here."

    col "We untied them and were about to head off to find you."

    edw "Oh! Dean Lashley…"

    pri "Don’t say anything, Edward."
    pri "There’s more important matters at hand."

    ## Eloise immediately gets into one of tanks that she built and it fills with water.
    ## The tank fills to the top and she drowns herself.
    ## But the tank then clouds up with an opaque liquid before opening up, dropping the dad from the sexworld into their world.
    ## Now there’s two dads.

    pov "Wait- what the fuck?"

    edw "That doesn’t look like that was supposed to happen…"

    mum "Honey?"
    mum "H- honey?"
    mum "Why are there two of you…?"

    swdad "Hey, you."

    dad "We finally meet."
    dad "I hope you enjoyed my world all these years."

    swdad "I could say the same for you."

    mum "Can someone explain what’s going on?!"

    pri "Where’s my sister?"
    pri "[povname]. Where did she go?"

    pov "I- I don’t know…"
    pov "If the worlds were suppose to work the way I thought it did, we would’ve gotten Xina…"
    pov "But-"
    pov "Dad?"
    pov "I mean- well…"

    swdad "Hey, [povname]."
    swdad "It’s been a while."
    swdad "Sorry we couldn’t meet up the previous time you came to visit."
    swdad "I was a bit preoccupied with… work."

    dad "At least be honest with your other son."
    dad "You were banging some co-workers."

    mum "Other- son?"
    mum "H-huh?  But-"

    ## Mum faints

    dad "Don’t worry about her, she’ll wake up eventually."

    swdad "Man, she’s a lot more innocent and naive that I remember."

    dad "My world has truly corrupted you."

    pov "Your world? What do you mean-?"
    pov "Who is who?!"
