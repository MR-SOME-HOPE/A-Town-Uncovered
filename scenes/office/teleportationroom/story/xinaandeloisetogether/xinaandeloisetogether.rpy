    "Eloise transported herself to the other dimension..."

    ## Cut to the other world where Eloise gets spit out from the teleportation tank.

    ## It takes a while for Eloise to get a grasp of where she is and gather herself.

    ## She stands up and faces Xina, the only one in the room.
    ## They walk up to each other and face each other. They ARE the same person that went down different paths.
