    ## Dad (because he’s from the SW) looks at the inscription and puts his hand on the MC.

    dad "You guys go."
    dad "Your dad and I got this."
    dad "Right?"

    swdad "Right."
    swdad "He’s right. Everyone get the fuck out of this building ASAP."

    pov "No! We need to do this together."

    dad "[povname]."
    dad "It’s gonna get really dangerous from here on out."
    dad "Your job isn’t to break the chain."
    dad "Your job right now is to keep everyone here safe."
    dad "Can you do that for me?"

    swdad "And if not for him, do it for them."

    ## Shot of everyone standing there worried and scared.

    pov "…"
    pov "Yes."
    pov "Alright."
    pov "Everyone, let’s get out of here!"
    pov "I’ll see you later, dad!"

    dad "…"

    swdad "See you, son."

    ## Everyone escapes the room and work their way out the building.

    ## The two dads look at each other and grab hold of either sides of the runes and start pulling with all their might.
