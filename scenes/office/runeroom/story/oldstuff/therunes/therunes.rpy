    "At the rune room..."

    ## You observe the Rune Room, the floating runes that are floating side by side, attached but not physically, maybe an inch apart from each other and yet in tandem with one another.

    ## You notice the alien language written on the runes.

    pov "Hmm…"
    pov "Do you know what these markings mean?"

    elo "I have no idea. They’re basically alien to us."
    elo "My guess is as good as yours."
    elo "There’s nothing on this Earth that follows any grammatical or lingual pattern of these symbols."

    pov "Hmph…"
    pov "These rocks-"
    pov "They aren’t touching?"
    pov "You said they were connected."

    elo "They are."
    elo "That’s what makes them extra extraterrestrial."
    elo "If you move one, the other moves as if they’re glued together."
    elo "But just like you said, they aren’t even physically touching."

    pov "Have you tried separating them?"

    elo "They are bonded by God himself, I feel."
    elo "Nothing can make them budge."

    idk "ELOISE!!"
    idk "ELOISE! WHERE ARE YOU?!"

    pov "That sounds like-"

    elo "Big sis!!"

    ## Lashley enters the room all nude and battered.

    ## Eloise hugs Lashley as tightly as possible and sobbing in her sister’s arms.

    elo "I’m sorry!"
    elo "I didn’t do this-"
    elo "I didn’t-"
    elo "Please…"
    elo "I don’t know what to do…"

    pri "Hey, hey. It’s okay."
    pri "I know you didn’t do this…"
    pri "It’s okay, El."
    pri "I’m okay, really."

    elo "{i}*Sobs*{/i}"
    elo "I’m sorry they attacked you-"
    elo "I would never want to hurt you!"

    pri "I know, El."
    pri "I know."

    ## Lashley sees the runes.
