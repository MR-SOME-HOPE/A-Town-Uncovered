    pov "Well, pretty spot on, yeah."
    show pov embarrassed_talk at left

    show pov embarrassed_talk at left
    show elo neutral at right
    pov "I will probably find out in a bit. Again, my father just screamed at me to come, and then proceeded to leave me at the door to figure the rest out by myself."
    show pov neutral_talk at left
