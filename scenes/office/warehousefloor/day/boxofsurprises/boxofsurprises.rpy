    "Jerry" "-So she tells me, Jerry, I know it's your birthday and I promised to do anything you wanted today for a change, but I am not putting on a Catgirl Maid outfit and pegging you with a strap on!"
    "Jerry" "She might as well have ripped my heart out and smashed it to pieces with a hammer right before my very eyes, man."
    "Jerry" "You give your everything to make a relationship work, bending over backwards to please them and the one time you ask them to fulfill your fantasies they leave you hanging like that."
    "Jerry" "It's messed up, Samantha, that's what it is."

    "Samantha" "You keep forgetting where we are, Jerry. You can't just ask that of the residents like that."
    "Samantha" "Sure, back home you might have gotten your guts rearranged if you just asked nicely, but here it's not that simple."

    "Jerry" "Makes me fucking sick just how much of a prude they are… We know them better than they know themselves yet when we give them the opportunity, they all chicken out!"

    "Samantha" "Look, just be thankful you didn't screw things up with them and we managed to bring them here before they started asking questions on your behavior."
    "Samantha" "Luckily we managed to make a convincing cover up for their disappearance so we won't have a town wide panic like last time."

    "Jerry" "Honestly, I'm more concerned about our missing test subject… Have they found a way to retrieve her yet?"

    "Samantha" "Ah yes, Experiment four-nine-eight, right?"

    "Jerry" "I rather just call her Erika."

    "Samantha" "Why do you only learn the names of the people who suck you off first?"

    "Jerry" "I keep a tier-list in my head of who gives better head!"
    "Jerry" "So I only care to learn the names of people of B or higher tier."
    "Jerry" "You are a solid A+ by the way~"

    "Samantha" "How flattering…"
    "Samantha" "Anyway, apparently they found her in front of the school making a mess of herself, so it quickly turned into a spectacle and they hauled her away."

    "Jerry" "Such a shame, she is great at public orgies yet these prudes don't give her a chance."

    "Samantha" "Can you be professional for once?!"
    "Samantha" "Do you not realize how serious this is?!"

    "Jerry" "Oh, relax! So she managed to get out and make a scene. What's the big deal?"
    "Jerry" "It's not like Mistress Xina won't send Vi to fetch her if it becomes an actual problem!"

    "Samantha" "After the mess that was the extraction of the latest targets the whole town is in a panic and that makes it harder to do our job!"
    "Samantha" "We've only added fuel to that fire by letting a missing girl appear out of nowhere as a mindless sex drone!"
    "Samantha" "Also, seriously? She managed to get away?"

    "Jerry" "Alright, Alright. I may have misjudged how much we had amped her sex drive during the latest testing cycle."
    "Jerry" "And I may have been unable to keep up by just a slim margin in our stamina."
    "Jerry" "And she may have slipped out of my sight when I was trying to catch my breath."

    "Samantha" "You were on the ground unconscious over a pool of your own cum, her pussy juices and with friction burns on your dick after she fucked you senseless."
    "Samantha" "So when your dick couldn't possibly get hard anymore, she left the testing chamber in search for someone else to stuff her since you forgot to close the doors!"

    "Jerry" "I mean, If you needlessly phrase it like that it does sound bad so I'd rather stick to my version of events."

    "Samantha" "You are an idiot."
    "Samantha" "Look, just… tell me how the analytics look for experiment six-two-six."

    "Jerry" "Ah yes, our messy extraction, right?"
    "Jerry" "They are looking good! She seems to be accepting the program quite well, definitely faster than it was for Erica at least."

    "Samantha" "Hmm… Perhaps there is some weight to Doctor Maxwell's theory that the more sexually frustrated a subject, the faster they'll assimilate to the training?"

    "Jerry" "Seems to be the case… It didn't take long at all with the additional test subject we got from her extraction."
    "Jerry" "Where is he, by the way? He is not on his stasis tube."

    "Samantha" "Oh, I'm doing some extra curricular program routines on him in the testing area."
    "Samantha" "He is quite… Energetic… I think I'm gonna keep him once our work is done~"

    "Jerry" "And you call me unprofessional."
    "Jerry" "Does the boss even know you are doing this?"

    eff "Shit… I don't think we can leave without them noticing."

    pov "Let's just be thankful we managed to hide in time for now… Can you see anything?"

    eff "Kind of, but we can definitely hear them so that's a plus."
    eff "So they also took Erica then… and from the sounds of it, they've taken a lot more people too."
    eff "Are all the disappearances in town related to them then?"

    pov "It's a safe bet..."

    eff "But what reason could they possibly have for kidnapping people? Not to mention hooking them up to those… Did he call them stasis machines?"

    pov "No clue why they could be doing this or why they are hooking them up to those things, but before we turn into the next on the list to get in a tube, we need to find a way out of here!"

    eff "I know, I know! Any ideas, Einstein?!"

    "Jerry" "Probably just the tubes going through the gel replacement cycle."

    "Samantha" "Right... Anyway, where was I?"

    eff "Oh thank God, that was a close one."

    edw "Have they managed to spot you?!"

    eff "Thankfully not yet, but we can't get out without them spotting us and who knows how long they'll be here."

    jac "Oh man, that's really bad."

    edw "Any clues as to what they are doing?"

    eff "They seem to be chatting while looking over the data of those stasis pods. The thing is, that if the numbers of experiments we've heard are accurate, we could be here all night."

    edw "What do you mean?"

    eff "Erica was one of their experiments… One that managed to get away after a round of 'testing'..."

    jac "Wait, so whatever was going on with Erica when we all found her at school."

    edw "Must be connected to whatever experiments they are doing and whatever those stasis pods are for."
    edw "Guys, we need to get you out of there."

    pov "I think you are stating the obvious there, man."
    pov "Question is, how do we do that without them noticing us?"

    edw "We need to cause a distraction of some kind… Maybe find a way to kill the lights?"

    pov "If we can cause a short circuit then the whole powerline for the warehouse should come down! Lights and cameras included!"

    eff "Without the cameras on we should be able to just sprint for the exit and get out of here without anyone noticing us!"
    eff "But I doubt we can cause a short circuit from within this box."

    edw "No, but Jacob can!"
    edw "Jacob, how far are you from the storage garage?"

    jac "I stopped when Effie told me to but I should be a few minutes away from it while also dodging the cameras!"

    edw "Okay, once you are there, I want you to head to the left side of the building."
    edw "The storage garage is so large that it must have its own fuse box."
    edw "Once you are there, we are going to cause a short circuit and if [povname]'s information about the electrical issues in this whole area are correct, we'll have a direct route out of here."

    jac "Alright, I can do that!"

    "Samantha" "Maybe Jeannette is just running late again?"
    "Samantha" "She's been getting railed by one of the guards for our Mistress, so maybe she decided to have some fun before work?"

    "Jerry" "Unlikely, considering today is her day off and the day she volunteers as relief for our Mistresses guard, so she isn't about to miss that to come to work."

    "Samantha" "If it's not her-"

    "Jerry" "All the important work is held on the lower levels and we haven't received any notice of an inspection by the supervisors so who could be coming up here aside from them?"
