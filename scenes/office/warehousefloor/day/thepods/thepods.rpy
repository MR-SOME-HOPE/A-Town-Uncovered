    #-Scene returns to the perspective of the MC as he and Effie enter the Storage
    # Garage-

    #-The garage is in the dark at the beginning while Mc and Effie get in, the
    # shot has them leaning against the door in the dark with only the dim light
    # from the door's window to illuminate them. The camera is focused on them and
    # not showing the interior just yet, this is for dramatic effect while they
    # find a light switch-

    pov "I can't see shit."
    pov "Effie, can you see anything?"

    eff "I'm literally in the same pitch black room as you."

    pov "Let's look around for a lightswitch or something."

    eff "Be careful with what you press, who knows what you might accidentally activate."

    pov "I'll go over here.."

    eff "*Huff*"
    eff "God, I still can't believe half of what we've found so far."
    eff "Not to mention the whole stalker board on you."

    pov "You are telling me… I mean, I knew already they were after me but I didn't realize it was to this extent."

    eff "I was still doubting your story at first but… What other reason could there be for them to be after you as badly as they are now?"
    eff "Still… A whole other world under the lake… One where everyone's having sex as casually as grabbing a cup of coffee with a friend?"
    eff "Honestly, take the weird cult trying to sacrifice you for some reason and it doesn't sound like a bad deal."

    pov "It really didn't at first but what the hell is going on in this town for it to even be a thing in the first place?"

    eff "I don't know, but if The Robotics Company is involved in some way then it's gotta be something big."
    eff "Perhaps that's what happened to my Mom…"
    eff "She went far too deep into this against the company and they-"

    pov "Hey, we have no real evidence if that's the case."
    pov "There's still a chance they aren't involved in this."
    pov "Just like there's still a chance for us to find out what happened to your mom."

    eff "[povname], you saw just as well as I did half the shit we found."
    eff "And if the whole sex world story actually is factual, what are the chances for my Mom who's been missing for years now?"
    eff "Especially when whoever is pulling the strings if this whole thing was more than happy to try and stick a knife in your chest in some kind of weird sex ritual?"
    eff "I'm just being realistic here, [povname]."

    pov "Feels like you are giving up before we find concrete evidence."
    pov "That's not the Effie I know."

    eff "I'm just-"
    eff "After all this strange shit we've found so far, I'm scared of going deeper and not liking what I'm going to find."

    pov "Effie, look where we are… we are already going waist deep into all of this stuff and it's a matter of time until it pulls us down the whole way."
    pov "I can't promise you we'll find anything at all related to your mom after all these years, but it's a start for you to finally get some answers and at the very least some closure."
    pov "And I think that out of all of us, you are the one who deserves it the most."

    eff "I-"
    eff "Yeah, You are right."
    eff "I can't crumble down now. Not when I'm so close to something after all these years."
    eff "Plus, it's not just my mom anymore, we have a whole board of potential victims and not to mention you are their biggest target."
    eff "I'm not gonna let that bitch take anyone else away from me, especially not you."

    pov "See? There's the Effie I do know!"

    eff "Well, you do bring up some solid points."
    eff "But…"

    pov "What is it?"

    eff "Davendithas' mom and his sibling… they disappeared after you took that whole trip to Sex World and they tried to sacrifice you, right?"
    eff "You don't possibly think that maybe they-"

    pov "No…"
    pov "At least, I don't think so?"
    pov "I mean, why bother keeping a whole stalker board just for me if they could just pick a random dude to take my place in the sacrifice after I escaped?"
    pov "I was too creeped out to go into much detail when I found it, but some of the information on that board was pretty recent."
    pov "Like my internship at the TRC and even our fight."

    eff "Wow, seriously?"
    eff "Even our whole argument?"

    pov "Well, we did argue in the middle of the cafe, so I'm not surprised they found out about that part, to be honest-"
    pov "But that's besides the point. What's important here is that if they are keeping such a close eye on me, then they most likely still want me for their own purposes."
    pov "So I doubt they are trying to replace me just like that."

    eff "Still… That only raises the question of what did they want with Davendithas' mother and his sibling in the first place."

    pov "Not to mention with everyone else on that board."

    eff "Well, we are not gonna find out just discussing it against ourselves."
    eff "Thanks for the pick me up, [povname]. "

    pov "Anytime. Now let's stop wasting time and let me find a light switch around here."
    pov "And honestly, I think this has been overwhelming for all of us but at least we can deal with it together, right?"
    pov "I wouldn't have gotten anywhere near this far if it wasn't for you guys, after all."

    eff "Absolutely! And honestly, after all the shit we've found so far, there can't be anything to top that, right?"

    #-The lights now turn on and Effie and the MC now look at the camera with a
    # neutral expression as an indication they are looking into the room, their
    # neutral expressions suddenly turning into ones of shock and horror as the
    # silent realization of what they are looking into dawn's on them-

    eff "I stand corrected yet again..."


    #-Scene now depicts a few takes of the lab before them, with all kinds of
    # equipment all through it but the most important of it all being the multiple
    # human sized pod-like machines lined up one next to the other. Of a classical
    # alien design, these pods look like cylindrical tubes filled with this bright
    # neon colored liquid with machinery on the top and bottom of their crystal
    # glass and a monitor strapped to its side to read on vitals and similar
    # important information.

    # Some of these tubes have the silhouettes of humans
    # within them but there are still several that remain empty, indicating that
    # there's still room for more potential victims. On the right back corner of
    # the room there is a large important looking computer and monitor.

    # Finally, on the left back corner of the room is a set of reinforced metallic
    # gates to a large elevator which leads down to the lower levels of the company
    # where the actual Sex World operations are taking place but the gang doesn't
    # know that part yet-

    # -Mc and Effie appear as their normal stand in sprites with a background
    # image that covers as much of the room layout as possible-

    pov "I…"
    pov "I don't-"
    pov "Just-"
    pov "What the hell is all of this?!"

    eff "Why are you asking me, how should I know?!"

    pov "I-Inside those tubes… are those people?!"

    eff "I… I think so."
    eff "What kind of weird shit are they doing in this company, [povname]?"

    pov "Now you are asking me?"

    eff "Well, you are the one working for them!"

    pov "As an unpaid intern in the office building!"
    pov "And granted, I've seen some crazy shit on my tours, but this…"
    pov "I… I don't even know where to start!"
    pov "Oh my god, is Jacob's theory about aliens actually right?"

    eff "I pray to God it's something else and not actual aliens. Because Jacob would never let it go even if we got every hole probed."
    eff "Look… Let's just take a look around first."
    eff "We gotta take some pictures for Jacob and Edward to look at all this and we can figure out what this whole mess is, okay?"

    pov "I suppose that's the only real option we have, right?"

    eff "Right. Let's start with the tubes and work our way up."
    
    pov "It's hard to see through that goop. It's like glue, I can barely make out the silhouette."
    pov "How should we start?"

    eff "Well, Davendithas' Mom has had her description blasted on the news for a while now."
    eff "Let's go through there and see if any of those people match her description."

    pov "Sounds like a plan."

    "After a bit..."

    eff "Any luck?"
    pov "I don't think so. You?"

    eff "I'm checking over this last one."
    eff "Hmm... birthmark on shoulder, shoulder length black hair..."
    eff "Tramp stamp with a queen of spades logo on the center- Yes!"
    eff "Oh my god, here she is!"

    pov "You are kidding Me, did we actually find her?!"

    eff "No doubt about it, this has to be her!"

    eff "Which means that the rest of these people must also be missing from the town."
    eff "And that the TRC is definitely involved in all of this!"
    eff "There's no way in hell they aren't in some way or another, who else would be able to have all this equipment in just a storage garage and get away with it?!"

    pov "I mean- I really can't argue with that."
    pov "Wouldn't be surprised if this was why they were having so many power issues."
    pov "But I'm certain not everyone in the TRC is involved with this."

    eff "I mean, yeah. I'm sure the people in your tech support department aren't really in the know, but the higher-ups definitely must be."
    eff "And even then, are we really sure of anything regarding them?"
    eff "I wouldn't discard the idea that people are keeping an eye out for you within the company if they have all this strange shit in their warehouse and no one's made a big deal about it."

    pov "Gee, thanks for the nerves the next time I head to the office."
    pov "Look, let's just focus on the situation at hand for now, okay?"
    pov "What should we do with Davendithas' Mom? And we still haven't found their sibling."

    eff "I mean, what exactly can we do?"
    eff "We don't even know what the hell she is actually hooked up to and I'm not gonna go pressing random buttons in case it ends up harming her!"

    pov "Well, we have to do something other than just take pictures!"

    eff "I'm not hearing any suggestions so far!"
    eff "We need to hurry and gather as much evidence we can before our time runs out or someone-"

    # -the two are interrupted by the sound of an automated announcement system
    # going off announcing the soon arrival of the elevator on the back of the garage-

    "Speaker" "High Speed Elevator Unit arriving at Laboratory station, please stand clear of the reinforced doors."

    eff "Oh shit, someone's coming!"

    pov "Wait, this place actually has an elevator?"

    eff "Now's not the time to ponder that, we gotta hide!"

    pov "Where?!"

    eff "Follow me and don't make a sound!"

    # -Effie and the MC disappear from the scene and we go back to the panoramic
    # view of the lab. Effie and MC are hiding inside some boxes near the entrance-
