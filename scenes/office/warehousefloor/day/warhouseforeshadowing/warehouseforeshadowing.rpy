    #[Warehouse road, Morning - “Warehouse foreshadowing”  - main_story =116]

    #-Scene takes place in the middle of one of the main roads of the warehouse
    # area of The Robotics Company, both sides of the road have a row of warehouses
    # exactly identical to the next one all lined up until reaching an intersection
    # where more warehouses are visible running along the side. In the center of
    # the road there is a tram-like line where the golf carts are connected and
    # helps them travel the large area with ease. On one of the warehouses' roofs
    # or on tall antenna looking posts you #can see the occasional camera looking
    # down at the road. Currently, MC and Eloise are in the middle of the scene
    # on a golf cart with Eloise Driving it as the two make conversation-

    pov "S-Sorry about that…"

    elo "No need to apologize, I understand that this can be a bit boring considering I can only tell you what’s inside each of these warehouses instead of actually showing you."
    elo "I would love to show you everything and make this whole tour all the more interesting for you."
    elo "But there are still certain security protocols even I can’t overlook and considering your position, this is the best I can do."

    pov "No, no, no! I assure you I don’t have an issue with it or anything."

    elo "Is it difficult to talk about it?"

    pov "Thanks for the vote of confidence."

    elo "Just calling it like I see it, [povname]."
    elo "Anyway, think I can have you focus your attention on me for a few minutes? We are almost done with this part of the tour so I do have to go over some of the basics here."

    pov "We are still going for a full tour vibe, huh?"

    elo "Hey, you never know if I’ll need you to come over here again, so I want to at least make sure you get the basic info of the place down."
    elo "Plus, if the power goes out on us it becomes a hassle to get around this place."

    pov "Does that happen often?"

    elo "Quite so I’m afraid."
    elo "We have separate generators to power this whole area of the company for cheap, but due to some… Very unwise planning decisions by the board… The electricity to this area is pretty much spread too thin."
    elo "To the point that if one of the warehouses has a short circuit of any kind, like while doing some testing or other such thing, it can bring the whole system down for the whole."

    pov "Shouldn’t that be something you guys try to fix immediately?"

    elo "Well, it’s just recently become a problem."
    elo "Used to only happen once or twice every few months and it wasn’t much of an issue worth looking into, but lately it seems to be happening quite frequently and we still have no real idea why."

    pov "Maybe people are testing their machines incorrectly?"

    elo "That's the thing, there are no records of any testing taking place yet the power outages keep happening, especially at night where this whole area is off limits."

    pov "You sure it isn’t someone sneaking in to do some extra work?"
    pov "You do have some passionate people working here, after all."

    elo "Late night testing is strictly prohibited due to the current events happening around town."
    elo "Plus if an experiment goes wrong someone could get really injured so I’ve instructed the security staff not to let anyone in under any circumstances."
    elo "Even the electric fence has been affected by the power outages."
    elo "It’s only thanks to our foresight that the camera system isn’t going through the same thing."
    elo "It runs on a separate power grid running separate from the mainline and luckily it hasn’t been affected by it, but from what I’ve seen in the reports, the outages have caused it to glitch a little."
    elo "A bad enough power surge could cause an area wide shut down and even the cameras might be affected."

    pov "Wow, I can see how that could become a huge problem."
    pov "Wait, so the electric fence isn’t working?"

    elo "Shhh, Keep it down, will you?!"
    elo "We are trying to keep that part a secret until we figure out what's causing the outages!"
    elo "I really shouldn’t be telling you this in the first place, so keep your mouth shut."

    pov "R-Right, sorry…"

    elo "But yes, it isn’t working after it’s main powersource was fried due to one of the outages."
    elo "Luckily we have been able to just pretend it's still working considering there aren’t that many people who would go around testing if a fence is electrified or not."
    elo "This is just a temporary thing while we set up a separate powersource for it much like wit the camera system."

    pov "This seems like a lot of needless trouble you guys could save by wiring everything to the town's power system like the rest of us normal people."

    elo "The amount of capital we save by generating our own power is enough for it to be considered one of our main priorities in the board meetings."

    pov "Cash is king even against practicality, huh?"

    elo "When you have to pay taxes and also afford basic living for you and your family, you’ll learn the importance of saving money wherever you are able to."
    elo "Those same principles apply even to companies like us. Why do you think most companies outsource their work in countries where things like safety, fair wages and basic human rights are more of a suggestion than a rule?"
    elo "Now pay attention, on this next part of our tour, I’ll show you the warehouse where one of our employees got his testicles crushed by one of our robotic hand prototypes!"
